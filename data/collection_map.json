SST is known to be a significant driver of global weather and climate patterns and to play important roles in the exchanges of energy, momentum, moisture and gases between the ocean and atmosphere. As such, its knowledge is essential to understand and assess variability and long-term changes in the Earth\u2019s climate.\nThe SST data provided here are based on measurements carried out by the following infrared sensors flown onboard multiple polar-orbiting satellites: the series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRRs), the series of Along Track Scanning Radiometers (ATSRs), and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR).\nThe dataset provides SST products of different processing levels. Only Level-3 Collated and Level-4 and served through this entry in the Catalogue. Due to the large number of files at Level-2 Pre-processed and Level-3 Collated these products are served through the Climate Data Store API. For more information on how to access these levels consult the documentation.\nThe four types of products are:\n\nLevel-2 Pre-processed (L2P): SST data on the native satellite swath grid and derived from single-sensor measurements.\nLevel-3 Uncollated (L3U): SST product generated by regridding L2P data onto a global latitude-longitude grid.\nLevel-3 Collated (L3C): global daily (day and night) single-sensor SST product based on collated L3U data.\nLevel-4 (L4): spatially complete global SST product based on data from multiple sensors.\n\nThese products are available as Climate Data Records (CDRs), which have sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to be used to assess climate variability and changes. These SST CDRs are identical to those produced as part of the European Space Agency (ESA) SST Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project. Interim CDRs (ICDRs) are produced at levels L3C and L4 on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) to extend the baseline CDRs. Both SST CDRs and ICDRs are generated using software and algorithms developed as part of the ESA SST CCI.\nUsers should use the most recent version of the dataset whenever possible.

This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\nERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities.\nAn uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble\nat three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience.\nSuch uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which\nhas evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas.\nTo facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too,\nthough monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.\nERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days. In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. In case that this occurs users are notified.\nThe data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution.\nIt is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast

thickness for the Arctic region based on satellite radar altimetry observations. Sea ice is an important component of our climate system and a sensitive indicator of climate change. Its presence or its retreat has a strong impact on air-sea interactions, the Earth\u2019s energy budget as well as marine ecosystems. It is recognized by the Global Climate Observing System as an Essential Climate Variable. Sea ice thickness is one of the parameters commonly used to characterise sea ice, alongside sea ice concentration, sea ice edge, and sea ice type, also available in the Climate Data Store.\nSatellite radar altimeters provide measurements of the sea ice freeboard, which is the difference between the height of the surface of sea ice and the surface of water in open leads (areas of open water within the sea ice). Because of the buoyancy of ice in water, typically about 90% of the ice thickness remains under water and thus the total ice thickness is about 10 times the freeboard. However, snow on top of sea ice changes this ratio and complicates the estimation of the ice thickness, requiring the use of auxiliary information about snow depth and density. The retrieval of ice thickness uses the narrow radar swath at the nadir of the satellite at full resolution of approximately 1-10 km and a point spacing of 300 meters. This Level-2 sea-ice thickness products (not provided here) is then gridded for a period of a month to obtain full coverage of a north polar grid at a resolution of 25 km. The algorithm used was developed as part of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) on Sea Ice.\nThe data provided here are Level-3 Collated (L3C) products: they contain monthly gridded values from orbit data from a single platform (Envisat or CryoSat-2) without interpolation or any other form of gap filling. The files also contain estimates of the algorithm uncertainty as well as a quality status flag indicating potential issues with the retrieval not captured in the algorithm uncertainty. Sources of uncertainty in the algorithm are related to the auxiliary data and to the use of different radar altimeter concepts in Envisat (pulse-limited) and CryoSat-2 (synthetic aperture radar).\nThis dataset combines a Climate Data Record (CDR), which has sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to be used to assess climate variability and change, and an Interim Climate Data Record (ICDR), which provides regular temporal extensions to the CDR and where consistency with the CDR is expected but not extensively checked. Here, the CDR is based on measurements from the RA-2 altimeter on Envisat (October 2002  to October 2010) and the SIRAL altimeter on CryoSat-2 (November 2010 to April 2020). The ICDR is based on observations from CryoSat-2 only (from April 2015 onward) and is updated monthly with a one-month delay behind real time. Users should note that the quality and accuracy of the data record are higher during the CryoSat-2 period than during the Envisat period. As a result, care should be taken when combining the two missions to assess long-term changes and trends. More information can be found in the Product User Guide and Product Quality Assessment Report.\nThis dataset is currently limited spatially to the Arctic region and temporally to the winter months of October through April due to unresolved bias originating from melting snow or open melt ponds in the remaining five months. For a similar reason, no sea-ice thickness data with sufficient quality exist for the Southern Hemisphere. The extension of the CDR/ICDR to other periods, regions, and radar altimeter missions is under development in the extension of the ESA CCI Sea Ice project (ESA CCI+).\nThis dataset is produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).", "keywords": ["Temporal coverage: Past", "Spatial coverage: Global", "Product type: Satellite observations", "Variable domain: Ocean (physics)"], "license": "proprietary", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[0.0, -89.0, 360.0, 89.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["1979-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2024-04-01T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-ice-thickness"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf", "title": "Licence to use Copernicus Products"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-sea-ice-thickness/form_98e677dc8cfe4e37743130d805bb1f50c93349c2709ae548446d3e36a8b828c3.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-sea-ice-thickness/constraints_0a249039254286955d2c92f517a2151b3d688cb0638665259eb9070554c689e8.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-sea-ice-thickness", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-sea-ice-thickness/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-sea-ice-thickness/layout_b9c89bcedf11ef72d4e7e2d83214468a797e4601f07fef639c26d9e8cef90326.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-level-global", "title": "Sea level gridded data from satellite observations for the global ocean from 1993 to present"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-surface-temperature-ensemble-product", "title": "Sea surface temperature daily gridded data from 1981 to 2016 derived from a multi-product satellite-based ensemble"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-ice-concentration", "title": "Sea ice concentration daily gridded data from 1978 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-ice-edge-type", "title": "Sea ice edge and type daily gridded data from 1978 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-surface-temperature", "title": "Sea surface temperature daily data from 1981 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-ice-thickness/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-sea-ice-thickness/overview_e65139269cab3aa583cfaa665c47fbef633ab8fbff34e26b2a07df1144af3e50.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2020-12-21T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2024-11-16T00:00:00Z", "sci:doi": "10.24381/cds.6679a99a", "cads:disabled_reason": null}, "derived-era5-single-levels-daily-statistics": {"type": "Collection", "id": "derived-era5-single-levels-daily-statistics", "stac_version": "1.0.0", "title": "ERA5 post-processed daily statistics on single levels from 1940 to present", "description": "ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 8 decades.\nData is available from 1940 onwards.\nERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis.\nReanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics.

ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that goes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the climate of the past. \nERA5-Land uses ERA5 atmospheric variables, such as air temperature and air humidity, as input to control the simulated land fields. This is called the atmospheric forcing. Without the constraint of the atmospheric forcing, the model-based estimates can rapidly deviate from reality. Therefore, while observations are not directly used in the production of ERA5-Land, they have an indirect influence through the atmospheric forcing used to run the simulation. In addition, the input air temperature, air humidity and pressure used to run ERA5-Land are corrected to account for the altitude difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-Land. This correction is called 'lapse rate correction'. \nThis catalogue entry provides post-processed ERA5-land hourly data aggregated to daily time steps.

Sea ice is an important component of our climate system and a sensitive indicator of climate change. Its presence or its retreat has a strong impact on air-sea interactions, the Earth\u2019s energy budget as well as marine ecosystems. It is recognized by the Global Climate Observing System as an Essential Climate Variable. Sea ice edge and type are some of the parameters used to characterise sea ice. Other parameters include sea ice concentration and sea ice thickness, also available in the Climate Data Store.\nSea ice edge and type are defined as follows:\n\nSea ice edge classifies the sea surface into open water, open ice, and closed ice depending on the amount of sea ice present in each grid cell. This variable is provided for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Note that a sea ice concentration threshold of 30% is used to distinguish between open water and open ice, which differs from the 15% threshold commonly used for other sea ice products such as sea ice extent.\nSea ice type classifies ice-covered areas into two categories based on the age of the sea ice: multiyear ice versus seasonal first-year ice. This variable is currently only available for the Northern Hemisphere and limited to the extended boreal winter months (October through April). Sea ice type classification during summer is difficult due to the effect of melting at the ice surface which disturbs the passive microwave signature.\n\nBoth sea ice products are based on measurements from the series of Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) sensors and share the same algorithm baseline. However, sea ice edge makes use of two lower frequencies near 19 GHz and 37 GHz and a higher frequency near 90 GHz whereas sea ice type only uses the two lower frequencies. This dataset combines Climate Data Records (CDRs), which are intended to have sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to assess climate variability and change, and Interim Climate Data Records (ICDRs), which provide regular temporal extensions to the CDRs and where consistency with the CDRs is expected but not extensively checked. For this dataset, both the CDR and ICDR parts of each product were generated using the same software and algorithms.\nThe CDRs of sea ice edge and type currently extend from 25 October 1978 to 31 December 2020 whereas the corresponding ICDRs extend from January 2021 to present (with a 16-day latency behind real time). All data from the current release of the datasets (version 3.0) are Level-4 products, in which data gaps are filled by temporal and spatial interpolation.

Sea ice is an important component of our climate system and a sensitive indicator of climate change. Its presence or its retreat has a strong impact on air-sea interactions, the Earth\u2019s energy budget as well as marine ecosystems. It is recognised by the Global Climate Observing System as an Essential Climate Variable. Sea ice concentration is defined as the fraction of a pixel or grid cell in a satellite image or other gridded product that is covered with sea ice. It is one of the parameters commonly used to characterise sea ice. Other sea ice parameters include sea ice thickness, sea ice edge, and sea ice type, also available in the Climate Data Store.\nThe dataset consists of two products:\n\nThe Global Sea Ice Concentration Climate Data Record produced by the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF). This is a coarse-resolution product based on measurements from the following sensors: Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR; 1979\u20131987), Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I; 1987\u20132006), and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS; 2005 onward). This product spans the period from 1979 to present and is updated daily. In the following, it is referred to as the SSMIS product.\nThe Global Sea Ice Concentration Climate Data Record produced by the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Phase 2 project (ESA CCI). This is a medium-resolution product based on measurements from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor (2002\u20132011) and its successor, AMSR2 (2012\u20132017). This product spans the 2002\u20132017 period and is not updated. In the following, it is referred to as the AMSR product.\n\nBoth products are provided on the same polar projection with a grid resolution of 25 km. However, the AMSR product has a true spatial resolution (as resolved by the sensor) of about 15\u201325 km versus 30\u201360 km for the SSMIS product. Therefore, the AMSR product provides a much more detailed view of the sea ice cover than the SSMIS product, especially along the marginal ice zone, the transitional zone between open water and the dense sea ice pack. On the other hand, the clear strength of the SSMIS product is its more than 40-year long and consistent record with daily updates.\nAlthough originating from different projects, the two products share the same algorithm baseline, which is both a continuation of the EUMETSAT OSI SAF approach and a series of innovations contributed mostly by ESA CCI activities. For both products, the underlying algorithm makes use of a combination of the same three temperature channels near 19 GHz and 37 GHz. The data also share a common data format so that interested users can revert some of the filtering steps and access the raw output of the SIC algorithms. Both are level-4 products in the sense that gaps are filled by temporal and spatial interpolation. However, gap filling is not applied to fill in days when no input satellite data are available.\nFurther details about each product can be found below as well as in the Documentation section.", "keywords": ["Temporal coverage: Past", "Spatial coverage: Global", "Product type: Satellite observations", "Variable domain: Ocean (physics)"], "license": "various", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[0.0, -89.0, 360.0, 89.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["1979-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2024-10-31T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-ice-concentration"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf", "title": "Licence to use Copernicus Products"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/ESA-CCI-sea-ice-concentration/ESA-CCI-sea-ice-concentration_8af13faa41f373e5ac56ec224eb0b2102a961cd68adedfdccd5c76e05e553c70.pdf", "title": "ESA-CCI sea ice concentration product licence"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/eumetsat-osi-saf-sic/eumetsat-osi-saf-sic_a42ac878deec1c647030bed88b93a1e0cc7091168f47192ea38fa603233fa364.pdf", "title": "EUMETSAT OSI SAF sea ice concentration disclaimer"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-sea-ice-concentration/form_eede140858a45b1613cc10bbba38ed66f82d7b9af71335d62138c50cb0c3060c.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-sea-ice-concentration/constraints_1a9fda9a3fbcdcd306c2a4b580a10a936f581472b296d8d63555b6f360f00f65.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-sea-ice-concentration", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-sea-ice-concentration/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-sea-ice-concentration/layout_71ce3901d65f1f1f8b0cd899eaaf3e58d47bdf9eecc5e84b57530e80c8f758c0.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-level-global", "title": "Sea level gridded data from satellite observations for the global ocean from 1993 to present"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-surface-temperature-ensemble-product", "title": "Sea surface temperature daily gridded data from 1981 to 2016 derived from a multi-product satellite-based ensemble"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-ice-edge-type", "title": "Sea ice edge and type daily gridded data from 1978 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-ice-thickness", "title": "Sea ice thickness monthly gridded data for the Arctic from 2002 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-surface-temperature", "title": "Sea surface temperature daily data from 1981 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-ice-concentration/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-sea-ice-concentration/overview_28363b274694d1b6a0a126e7b99f596bb43edf03eeca84729d42b30be06ab6f5.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2020-12-21T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2024-11-16T00:00:00Z", "sci:doi": "10.24381/cds.3cd8b812", "cads:disabled_reason": null}, "reanalysis-era5-land": {"type": "Collection", "id": "reanalysis-era5-land", "stac_version": "1.0.0", "title": "ERA5-Land hourly data from 1950 to present", "description": "ERA5-Land is a reanalysis dataset providing a consistent view of the evolution of land variables over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared to ERA5. ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that goes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the climate of the past. \nERA5-Land uses as input to control the simulated land fields ERA5 atmospheric variables, such as air temperature and air humidity. This is called the atmospheric forcing. Without the constraint of the atmospheric forcing, the model-based estimates can rapidly deviate from reality. Therefore, while observations are not directly used in the production of ERA5-Land, they have an indirect influence through the atmospheric forcing used to run the simulation. In addition, the input air temperature, air humidity and pressure used to run ERA5-Land are corrected to account for the altitude difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-Land. This correction is called 'lapse rate correction'.    \nThe ERA5-Land dataset, as any other simulation, provides estimates which have some degree of uncertainty. Numerical models can only provide a more or less accurate representation of the real physical processes governing different components of the Earth System. In general, the uncertainty of model estimates grows as we go back in time, because the number of observations available to create a good quality atmospheric forcing is lower.

This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\nERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities.\nAn uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble\nat three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience.\nSuch uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which\nhas evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas.\nTo facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too,\nthough monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.\nERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days. In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. In case that this occurs users are notified.\nThe data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution.\nIt is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast

The climate-relevant indicators for the energy sector considered are: air temperature, precipitation, incoming solar radiation, wind speed at 10 m and 100 m, and mean sea level air pressure. The energy indicators are electricity demand and power generation from various sources: wind (both onshore and offshore), solar and hydro (run-of-river and reservoir) power. Depending on the indicator, the data are available at the national, regional and grid (approximately 30x30 km) level for most European countries. The spatial aggregation of data over land uses the Eurostat NUTS0 & NUTS2 (Nomenclature des unit\u00e9s territoriales statistiques, 2016) regions. The offshore variables (e.g. offshore wind power) use the European maritime region definitions MAR0 and MAR1. Further information on the NUTS and MAR regions can be found in the documentation.\nThe C3S Energy operational service is composed of three main streams: historical (1979-present), seasonal forecasts and projections (typically covering the period 1970-2100). This historical dataset (1979-present) produces reference climate variables based on the ERA5 reanalysis. Energy variables are generated by transforming the climate variables using a combination of statistical models and physically based data. A comprehensive set of measured energy supply and demand data has been collected from various sources such as the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E).

This system comprises 5 ensemble members from which one member is published in this catalogue entry.\nReanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset taking into account the laws of physics. The reanalysis provides information without temporal and spatial gaps, i.e. the data are continuous in time, and the assimilation system provides information on every model grid point independently of whether observations are available nearby or not.\nThe OCEAN5 reanalysis system uses the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) ocean model and the NEMOVAR ocean assimilation system. NEMOVAR uses the so-called 3D-Var FGAT (First Guess at Appropriate Time) assimilation technique, which assimilates sub-surface temperature, salinity, sea-ice concentration and sea-level anomalies.\nThe ORAS5 data is forced by either global atmospheric reanalysis (for the consolidated product) or the ECMWF/IFS operational analysis (for the operational product) and is also constrained by observational data of sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, sea-ice concentration, global-mean-sea-level trends and climatological variations of the ocean mass.\nThe consolidated product (referred to as \"Consolidated\" in the download form) uses reanalysis atmospheric forcing (ERA-40 until 1978 and ERA-Interim from 1979 to 2014) and re-processed observations. The near real-time (referred to as \"Operational\" in the download form) ORAS5 product is available from 2015 onwards and is updated on a monthly basis 15 days behind real time. It uses ECMWF operational atmospheric forcing and near real time observations. The consolidated data benefits from atmospheric forcing consistency. The operational data benefits from near real-time latency.\nORAS5 data are also available at the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and at the Integrated Climate Data Centre (ICDC), Hamburg University.  The present dataset, at the time of publication, provides more variables than the others and has regular updates with near real-time data. For the period from 2015 to the present, the operational ORAS5 data provided in the CDS is different from the dataset provided by CMEMS, because different atmospheric forcings and ocean observation data were used in the generation of the two products.\nThe ORAS5 dataset is produced by ECMWF and funded by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).", "keywords": ["Product type: Reanalysis", "Temporal coverage: Past", "Spatial coverage: Global", "Variable domain: Ocean (physics)"], "license": "proprietary", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[0.0, -89.0, 360.0, 89.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["1958-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2024-09-01T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/reanalysis-oras5"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf", "title": "Licence to use Copernicus Products"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/reanalysis-oras5/form_86b508bfce07def5cbf9f35598d793ddb1d522de562b41fd889166522dcd584c.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/reanalysis-oras5/constraints_8112780d70c1f58404e690c9c687924fca1b03050188816f68bab20efa73ef50.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/reanalysis-oras5", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/reanalysis-oras5/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/reanalysis-oras5/layout_3976fb9e3bb1b47a2c4940df981390fabc48fe388923a3b5716efb7438f55ec0.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/sis-water-level-change-indicators-cmip6", "title": "Global sea level change indicators from 1950 to 2050 derived from reanalysis and high resolution CMIP6 climate projections"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/ecv-for-climate-change", "title": "Essential climate variables for assessment of climate variability from 1979 to present"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/sis-water-level-change-timeseries-cmip6", "title": "Global sea level change time series from 1950 to 2050 derived from reanalysis and high resolution CMIP6 climate projections"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/reanalysis-oras5/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/reanalysis-oras5/overview_328def6acb9afebab2ea7a3b49102c38e53d56cd6c662797d91d098043fd9a74.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2021-09-10T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2024-11-15T00:00:00Z", "sci:doi": "10.24381/cds.67e8eeb7", "cads:disabled_reason": null}, "satellite-soil-moisture": {"type": "Collection", "id": "satellite-soil-moisture", "stac_version": "1.0.0", "title": "Soil moisture gridded data from 1978 to present", "description": "This dataset provides estimates of surface soil moisture over the globe from a large set of satellite sensors.

The climate-relevant indicators for the energy sector considered are: air temperature, precipitation, incoming solar radiation, wind speed at 10 m and 100 m, and mean sea level air pressure. The energy indicators are electricity demand and power generation from various sources: wind (both onshore and offshore), solar and hydro (run-of-river and reservoir) power. Depending on the indicator, the data are available at the national, regional and grid (approximately 30x30 km) level for most European countries. The spatial aggregation of data over land uses the Eurostat NUTS0 & NUTS2 (Nomenclature des unit\u00e9s territoriales statistiques, 2016) regions. The offshore variables (e.g. offshore wind power) use the European maritime region definitions MAR0 and MAR1. Further information on the NUTS and MAR regions can be found in the documentation.\nData is provided for the European domain, in a multi-variable, multi-timescale view of the climate and energy systems. This is beneficial in anticipating important climate-driven changes in the energy sector, through either long-term planning or medium-term operational activities. This is also used to investigate the role of temperature on electricity demand across Europe, as well as its interaction with the variability of renewable energy generation.\nThe C3S Energy operational service is composed of three main streams: historical (1979-present), seasonal forecasts and projections (typically covering the period 2005-2100). This projections dataset (2005-2100) produces reference climate variables based on the European regional climate model experiment, CORDEX. Energy variables are generated by transforming the climate variables using a combination of statistical models and physically based data.

Each annual CDR is given a version number.\nThe differences in the geographical location of the two sheets result in site-specific processing:\nGreenland: Data consists of surface elevation change rate and its uncertainty in a five-year (for the early satellites: ERS-1, ERS-2, and ENVISat) or three-year (for CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3A) moving window. The moving window is advanced at one-month steps. Elevation measurements from satellite radar altimetry are used to build time-series of elevation change by the most optimal combination of the crossover-, repeat-track- and plane-fitting methods. The timeseries is derived for each cell on a 25km by 25km polar stereographic grid, covering the main Greenland ice sheet, and not including peripheral glaciers and ice caps. Data gaps have been filled using an ordinary Kriging interpolation method, and the distance to the nearest observational point is provided as utility information. The distance can be used to flag filled data.\nAntarctica: Data consists of surface elevation change rate over a five-year moving window that advances in one-month steps. It covers the Antarctic ice sheet, ice shelves and associated ice rises and islands on a 25km by 25km polar stereographic grid. Elevation measurements from five satellite radar altimetry missions, ERS1, ERS2, EnviSat, CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3A, are used to produce timeseries of surface elevation change by the crossover method for each grid cell. The mission timeseries are cross-calibrated into a consistent record, which is used to derive surface elevation change rates and their uncertainty estimates in each cell and time-window. Data gaps are flagged but not filled.", "keywords": ["Temporal coverage: Past", "Temporal coverage: Present", "Variable domain: Land (cryosphere)", "Product type: Satellite observations", "Spatial coverage: Antarctic and Greenland"], "license": "proprietary", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[0.0, -90.0, 360.0, 90.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["1992-01-01T00:00:00Z", null]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-ice-sheet-elevation-change"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/creative-commons-attribute-4-international-licence/creative-commons-attribute-4-international-licence_c590ec322e16932f8b93b4b8ab217421986470c9bbe99a7b1c74f0f62cc5f7b9.pdf", "title": "Creative Commons Attribute 4.0 International License"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-ice-sheet-elevation-change/form_75b44ab116ee483745a67edf258ac2e95678308727eb84665ad787b8f04817d5.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-ice-sheet-elevation-change/constraints_d38bc2a5a2420d1b4715fc223a208b6843d5ad1a9a41bb5e3db11266e0a06113.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-ice-sheet-elevation-change", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-ice-sheet-elevation-change/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-ice-sheet-elevation-change/layout_dcbc1f9bfd797dd7e6fc62f359e40275c99d83596e8364053cdd90e87b7ab2d2.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-greenland-ice-sheet-velocity", "title": "Greenland ice sheet annual gridded velocity data from 2017 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-ice-sheet-mass-balance", "title": "Gravimetric mass balance data for the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets from 2003 to 2022 derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-ice-sheet-elevation-change/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-ice-sheet-elevation-change/overview_836c795f49061de391f5e4e757cafecf8977dfbf9e3fa91048007916e5fc64d7.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2020-10-30T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2024-11-13T00:00:00Z", "sci:doi": "10.24381/cds.056d0df7", "cads:disabled_reason": null}, "sis-heat-and-cold-spells": {"type": "Collection", "id": "sis-heat-and-cold-spells", "stac_version": "1.0.0", "title": "Heat waves and cold spells in  Europe derived from climate projections", "description": "The dataset contains the number of hot and cold spell days using different European-wide and national/regional definitions developed within the C3S European Health service.\n These heat wave and cold spell days are available for different future time periods and use different climate change scenarios.\nA heat wave or cold spell is a prolonged period of extremely high or extremely low temperature for a particular region.

derived from satellite microwave observations", "description": "This dataset provides global estimates of daily accumulated and monthly means of precipitation. The precipitation estimates are based on a merge of passive microwave observations from two different radiometer classes operating on multiple Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites.\nSpaceborne passive microwave (MW) provides the most effective measurements for the remote sensing of precipitation because the MW upwelling radiation is directly responsive to the cloud microphysical structure and, in particular, to the emission and scattering properties of precipitation-size hydrometeors (solid and liquid). However, they are available at low spatial and temporal resolution, due to the limited number of passes per day (depending on latitude and number of platforms) at each location.\n On the other hand, infrared (IR) sensors, available also on geostationary platforms, provide measurements that mostly respond to upper-level cloud structure, but at much higher temporal and spatial resolution. Since precipitation is not directly sensed in the infrared, these observations are often merged with microwave-based precipitation estimates and rain gauges. A precipitation product merging IR and MW is also available on the Climate Data Store: GPCP precipitation dataset.\nThe two different radiometer classes used in the present  Copernicus micrOwave-based gloBal pRecipitAtion (COBRA) dataset are: \ni) Conically scanning MW imagers; observations obtained by applying methodologies of the Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite (HOAPS) in the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF).\nii) Cross-track scanning MW sounders; observations obtained through the dedicated Passive microwave Neural network Precipitation Retrieval for Climate Applications (PNPR-CLIM) algorithm.\nThis datset is independent of IR imagery and rain-gauge observations. \nA pure passive MW-based precipitation dataset overcomes the challenges and limitations of precipitation estimates based on IR observations, and the issues related to the inadequacy of the rain gauge networks in some regions and their almost complete absence over the ocean. \nThe main limitations, however, are linked to the varying (in time and space) revisiting time of the LEO satellites and low temporal sampling compared to geostanionary IR observations.\nThis dataset is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).", "keywords": ["Temporal coverage: Past", "Spatial coverage: Global", "Variable domain: Land (hydrology)", "Product type: Satellite observations", "Variable domain: Atmosphere (surface)", "Provider: Copernicus C3S"], "license": "proprietary", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[0.0, -89.0, 360.0, 89.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["2000-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2017-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-precipitation-microwave"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf", "title": "Licence to use Copernicus Products"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-precipitation-microwave/form_b42bc3074a7f0505f9d0b3153844a241c786dca2475d2e96cb5af07e4a5f65a8.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-precipitation-microwave/constraints_2c8cdea61c33556069ed9fa09752043f5ca60f0c1afd5b3cab3872f2a6a299fa.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-precipitation-microwave", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-precipitation-microwave/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-precipitation-microwave/layout_c66365a40cdd642e70a4b6cafb58f8e335b5b5a189d09cb6410cccb3f73d30c1.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-precipitation-microwave/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-precipitation-microwave/overview_3dd1a18e97f25b70ac7e900cd05d6ed9cd4c9b151e41bd9bbe3f3ec51867c89f.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2022-02-25T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2024-11-12T00:00:00Z", "sci:doi": "10.24381/cds.ada9c583", "cads:disabled_reason": null}, "sis-extreme-indices-cmip6": {"type": "Collection", "id": "sis-extreme-indices-cmip6", "stac_version": "1.0.0", "title": "Climate extreme indices and heat stress indicators derived from CMIP6 global climate projections", "description": "The dataset provides climate extreme indices related to temperature and precipitation as defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), as well as selected heat stress indicators (HSI). The indices are provided for historical and future climate projections (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and used in the 6th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This dataset provides a comprehensive source of pre-calculated and consistent ETCCDI and heat stress indicators commonly used by the climate science and impact communities. The majority of models used in this catalogue entry are now available in the Climate Data Store though the indices offered in this entry additionally include ensemble members obtained from the Earth System Grid Federation.\nThe indices are calculated from CMIP6 models that have the necessary daily resolved data for both historical and at least two of the future projections. In addition, four of the chosen models contained a large number of ensemble members in order to enable the estimation of the associated uncertainty in the spread of model outcomes when calculating the ETCCDI indices (CanESM5, EC-Earth3, MIROC6 and MPI-ESM1-2-LR). All the ETCCDI indices in this dataset are calculated using the climdex.pcic R package, which was developed, evaluated and approved by the ETCCDI.\nTo facilitate the usage of heat stress indicators in combination with thresholds on absolute values, this dataset additionally provides bias-adjusted heat stress indicators. Bias adjustment is carried out using the ISIMIP3b bias-adjustment method and employs the WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied to ERA5 (WFDE5) dataset as reference. Providing both pre-calculated bias-adjusted data and data without bias adjustment is of great value for climate and impact studies since the calculation of these datasets also are computationally expensive. The WFDE5 dataset is also available in the Climate Data Store.\nThe heat stress indicators combine near-surface air temperature, near-surface specific humidity, and surface air pressure to give indications of adverse effects of heat on human health. Other variables like wind or solar radiation are not considered, and the selected heat stress indicators thus represent indoor conditions or calm conditions in the shade.\nThis dataset was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.", "keywords": ["Temporal coverage: Past", "Spatial coverage: Global", "Variable domain: Land (biosphere)", "Product type: Climate projections", "Temporal coverage: Future", "Product type: Climate indices"], "license": "proprietary", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[-180.0, -90.0, 180.0, 90.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [[null, null]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/sis-extreme-indices-cmip6"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/cicero-cmip6-indicators-licence/cicero-cmip6-indicators-licence_ba997e52f2423143e053ae30684aaaee1769d2e827611938366112bedccac5a1.pdf", "title": "CMIP6 indicators dataset licence (CICERO)"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/sis-extreme-indices-cmip6/form_71e2dd8e8dad165201db97e594396dc24cc3ea1b1bee6e2b9d7def659f1a0f46.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/sis-extreme-indices-cmip6/constraints_f13a5697e84a36c42d63b573019b9a5cd77d5d16ec7693fdefb247df5bae5d43.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/sis-extreme-indices-cmip6", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/sis-extreme-indices-cmip6/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/sis-extreme-indices-cmip6/layout_39141dd8887f209c6fae2f56a6973fa2b23a9490c85bcc99d39fb7ad0b81e8f4.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/sis-extreme-indices-cmip6/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/sis-extreme-indices-cmip6/overview_141ac00dd0ca61fd0ace65c3dd1b36395546b02883ad6d6a0e03bbbad3dc9bb8.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2022-01-14T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2024-11-12T00:00:00Z", "sci:doi": "10.24381/cds.776e08bd", "cads:disabled_reason": null}, "insitu-observations-gruan-reference-network": {"type": "Collection", "id": "insitu-observations-gruan-reference-network", "stac_version": "1.0.0", "title": "In situ temperature, relative humidity and wind profiles from 2006 to March 2020 from the GRUAN reference network", "description": "The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN) is an international reference observing network, established in 2006, of sites measuring essential climate variables above Earth's surface, designed to fill an important gap in the current global observing system. GRUAN measurements are providing high-quality climate data records from the surface, through the troposphere, and into the stratosphere. These are being used to determine trends, constrain and calibrate data from more spatially comprehensive observing systems (including satellites and current radiosonde networks), and provide appropriate data for studying atmospheric processes. GRUAN is envisaged as a global network of eventually 30-40 sites that, to the extent possible, builds on existing observational networks and capabilities.\nGRUAN observation processing is designed to adjust systematic errors in radiosonde measurements of pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind, and to quantify how the uncertainties related to these error sources are derived. \nThis characterization ensures the traceability to SI units or accepted standards, providing extensive metadata and full documentation of measurements and algorithms.\nThis allows the full reprocessing from the raw data.\nThe Climate Data Store provides access to the GRUAN data version 2 (V2). Currently, only two GRUAN data products (GDP), for Vaisala RS92 and for Meisei RS-11G sondes, are available. In due time (expected early 2021) GRUAN data products for the new Vaisala RS41 sondes will be added. Specific GRUAN data products for other sonde types are also under development. \nThe current dataset provides radiosoundings from 17 stations.\nThe GRUAN dataset provides the vertical aggregation of 12 quantities as listed below in the main-variables table. \nAttributes are described in the related-variables tables.\nRadiosoundings can be downloaded as comma-separated values (CSV) files organised in two different ways:\n\nCSV one row per level: for each observed height all variables are provided as individual columns in one row. \nEach main variable has its dedicated columns for related uncertainty and bias correction, where applies (referenced as csv-lev in the variable lists below). \nCSV one row per observation: no aggregation; each row provides information about one variable at one level only. \nAll main variable are grouped together in the following columns: one for the observed variable (indicates variable in question), one for observation value,\none column for each of the three flavours of uncertainty and one for bias correction (referenced as csv-obs in the variable lists below).\n\nMore details about the the GRUAN dataset are given in the Documentation section, and\ngeneral information and background can be obtained from the GRUAN website (www.gruan.org).", "keywords": ["Temporal coverage: Past", "Spatial coverage: Global", "Product type: In-situ observations", "Variable domain: Atmosphere (upper air)"], "license": "various", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[0.0, -89.0, 360.0, 89.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["1978-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2018-10-17T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/insitu-observations-gruan-reference-network"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf", "title": "Licence to use Copernicus Products"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/gruan-data-policy/gruan-data-policy-2015_a738dbaa41185494bb2a7aaef0c03f276fd4dfa9ade68fd8afa21012a1af6b08.pdf", "title": "GRUAN data policy"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/insitu-observations-gruan-reference-network/form_ae7ebaf94832258d3c445d9b2f7c489ac1328f7418ddce9b30397e425f68404b.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/insitu-observations-gruan-reference-network/constraints_666eedb3ac3fabda42b1f735b875a8804683f756e2a990980c5271520113b805.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/insitu-observations-gruan-reference-network", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/insitu-observations-gruan-reference-network/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/insitu-observations-gruan-reference-network/layout_97d8ca1b9945a437346d7b6a4bf32e733a7e9518573d1828ab2a71de9257609f.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/insitu-observations-gnss", "title": "In-situ observations of water vapour and atmospheric delay from the ground-based GNSS network from 1996 to present"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/insitu-comprehensive-upper-air-observation-network", "title": "Comprehensive upper-air observation network from 1905 to present"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/insitu-observations-woudc-ozone-total-column-and-profiles", "title": "In situ total column ozone and ozone soundings from 1924 to present from the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/insitu-observations-igra-baseline-network", "title": "In situ observations of meteorological variables from the Integrated Global Radiosounding Archive and the Radiosounding Harmonization dataset from 1978 onward"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/multi-origin-c3s-atlas", "title": "Gridded dataset underpinning the Copernicus Interactive Climate Atlas"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/insitu-observations-gruan-reference-network/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/insitu-observations-gruan-reference-network/overview_7db533ea4470d375ef692873fc53a8f0f1ecc7c53e210fc605d8a00540f2780b.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2020-04-27T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2024-11-12T00:00:00Z", "sci:doi": "10.24381/cds.1833f584", "cads:disabled_reason": "Download form temporarily closed.

The dataset contains Essential Climate Variable (ECV) data in the form of daily mean river discharge and a set of climate impact indicators (CIIs) for both water quantity and quality. \nECV datasets provide the empirical evidence needed to understand the current climate and predict future changes. \nCIIs contain condensed climate information which facilitate relatively quick and efficient subsequent analysis. Therefore, CIIs make climate information accessible to application focussed users within a sector.\nThe ECVs and CIIs provided here were derived within the water management sectoral information service to address questions specific to the water sector. However, the products are provided in a generic form and are relevant for a range of sectors, for example agriculture and energy.\nThe data represent the current state-of-the-art in Europe for regional climate and hydrological modelling and indicator production. Eight bias adjusted model simulations from the EURO-CORDEX EUR-11 were used to force a multi-model setup of the hydrological model E-HYPEcatch at a pan-European domain. A total of 18 water quality and quantity CIIs and 1 water ECV are provided in this dataset at catchment scale and on a 5km x 5km grid. \nThe CIIs are provided as mean values over a 30-year time period. For the reference period (1971-2000) data is provided as absolute values, for the future periods the data is provided as absolute values and as the relative or absolute change from the reference period.

These are a physically realistic set of plausible windstorm events based on the modelled climatic conditions. It is not designed to reproduce actual historical observations but as a comparator for the stochastic event sets generally used for windstorm risk analysis in the insurance industry. This is because there is no data assimilation process used to align the model output to historical observations. The dataset aims to capture the windstorms' risk profile over the winter months and consider the characteristics of windstorms in a warming climate. The dataset may be downloaded by selecting the required years and months from which daily files are produced. These are there as mere reference; the associated storms bare no resembelence to what was actually observed and recorded at the time.\nThe windstorms are identified from the maximum 3 second wind gusts derived from the 10m wind speed from the Met Office HadGEM3 model using the Global Atmosphere 3 and Global Land 3 configurations.

The dataset has been produced using the marine ecosystem model, ERSEM v15.06 (European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model), coupled to the regional ocean circulation models, POLCOMS (the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Ocean Modelling System) and NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) using the FABM (Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models) coupler. ERSEM is designed to simulate the cycles of carbon and the major nutrient elements nitrogen, phosphorous and silicon within the marine environment. Organisms at the base of the marine food web \u2013 the microscopic aquatic plants known as phytoplankton \u2013 play an integral role in these cycles and are explicitly represented in the model. So are the microscopic marine organisms which feed upon them and provide a vital link to commercially exploited species of fish and shell fish higher up the food chain.\nPOLCOMS and NEMO are well-established physical models with the ability to simulate regions that include both the deep ocean and the continental shelf. They track the movement of water and transfer of energy and momentum in three dimensions, enabling the water temperature, salinity (the salt content of sea water) and currents to be modelled.

The dataset includes physical variables, such as horizontal velocity components, temperature and salinity; and a range of biogeochemical variables, including the concentration of dissolved oxygen and the concentration of different nutrients. These variables were simulated under two future scenarios, based on different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) for future greenhouse gas emissions: the intermediate scenario, RCP4.5, in which greenhouse gas emissions peak around 2040 before declining; and the business as usual scenario, RCP8.5, in which greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise throughout the century.

The indicators calculated include extreme-value indicators (e.g. return periods including confidence bounds for total water levels and surge levels), probability indicators (e.g. percentile for total water levels and surge levels). They provide a basis for studies aiming to evaluate sea level variability, coastal flooding, coastal erosion, and accessibility of ports at a global scale. The extreme value statistics for different return periods can be used to assess the frequency of an event and form the basis of risk assessments. The global coverage allows for world-wide assessments that are particularly useful for the data scarce regions where detailed modelling studies are currently lacking.\nThe indicators are computed from time series data available in a related dataset in the Climate Data Store named Global sea level change time series from 1950 to 2050 derived from reanalysis and high resolution CMIP6 climate projections (see Related data), where further details of the modelling are provided. The indicators are produced for three different 30-year periods corresponding to historical, present, and future climate conditions (1951-1980, 1985-2014, and 2021-2050). The future period is based on global climate projections using the high-emission scenario SSP5-8.5. The dataset is based on climate forcing from ERA5 global reanalysis and 4 Global Climate Models (GCMs) of the high resolution Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) global climate projection dataset from the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) multi-model ensemble.

These are derived from i) the network of meteorological stations included in the European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D) programme and ii) dynamically downscaled ERA5 reanalysis at 2 km x 2 km (ERA5-2km) using the regional climate model COSMO-CLM and accounting for urban parameterization, specifically performed for the 20 European cities identified as vulnerable to urban pluvial flooding.\nAt the European scale, E-OBS and ERA5 precipitation data are used to compute indicators at different temporal resolutions (i.e. daily, monthly, yearly, and 30-year) according to the type of indicator. The precipitation amounts at fixed return periods are also computed for point observations from meteorological stations using the ECA&D network and are then interpolated onto the E-OBS grid.

LAPrec was constructed to satisfy high climatological standards, such as temporal consistency and the realistic reproduction of spatial patterns in complex terrain.

Data are available at the observational level and also at daily and monthly aggregations. Data have been collated and harmonised and quality control checks have been performed, but no attempt has been made to assess for potential biases. Data are provided for a range of commonly observed variables.\nSurface meteorological observations taken by a broad variety of organisations, including but not limited to National Meteorological Services, are being collated, reconciled, and harmonised. This work provides data that can underpin the development of reanalyses products as well as the production of gridded products and data services. \nWork is ongoing to prepare and analyse several hundred sources secured to date and new sources continue to accrue. Documentation on sources secured to date can be found in the inventory information provided in the documentation tab. Users with new sources are invited to upload these via the data deposition service for ingestion and consideration. Sources are available in a broad range of formats and frequently individual series have been shared multiple times. Steps have been undertaken to harmonise data formats and reconcile data sources to yield the longest possible individiual station records. \nStation period-of-record varies on a station-by-station basis with most stations starting after 1950, but many stations extending much further back in time. Daily and monthly aggregations extend further back in time than sub-daily records in general. Periodic updates and reissues shall refresh historical holdings availability and will also build on aspects such as quality checking and flagging of data. Each such release will be accompanied by a version number increment and a reissue of the product user guide. Updates for recent observations are in process of being provided at a latency of 1-2 days for those stations that are operational and sharing data across the WMO Information System, starting with updates to the daily holdings.\nData are available for several commonly observed variables as described in the main variables table. Note that which variables are available varies by the chosen timescale of data aggregation and by station. To aid users an inventory of stations by name, location, start and end date, and variables available is provided in the documentation page differentiated by timescale. Attributes are described in the related-variables tables and users can choose whether to receive all attributes or solely essential attributes. Data are downloaded as comma-seperated values (CSV) files organised as one observations of one variable per row.\nUsers should ensure an appropriate assessment of long-term data quality prior to use in those applications which require consideration of such aspects.   \nMore details about the land meteorological station holdings are available in the product user guide, and details around data formatting can be found in the common data model documentation, both of which can be found in the documentation section. \nThis work is being completed on behalf of C3S in sustained collaboration with

water levels from 1992 to present derived from satellite observations", "description": "This dataset provides lake water levels for 251 selected lakes on four continents derived from satellite radar altimetry. Lake water level information is traditionally obtained via ground-based observation systems and networks that suffer from well-known inherent problems: high cost, sparse coverage (often limited to political local/national instead of geographical/hydrological boundaries), slow dissemination of data, heterogeneous temporal coverage, destruction of the stations during floods, absence of stations in remote areas, absence of management strategy, etc. \nAlthough originally conceived to study open ocean processes, the radar altimeter satellites have nevertheless acquired numerous useful measurements over lakes. With this technique, the Lake Water Level is defined as the height, in meters above the geoid (the shape that the surface would take under the influence of the gravity and rotation of Earth) of the reflecting surface. It is observed by space radar altimeters that measure the time it takes for radar pulses to reach the ground targets, directly below the spacecraft (nadir position), and return. Hence, only lakes located along the satellite's ground tracks can be monitored, with a quality of measurement that not only depends of the size of the lake, but also on the reflecting targets in its surroundings such as topography or vegetation. For each of the key lakes monitored in the C3S Lakes production system, the Level-3 Water Level is provided in separate file along with the corresponding uncertainty.\nThis altimetric technique, that can complement ground-based observations systems, potentially provides a major improvement in the field of continental hydrology, due to the global coverage (however limited to Earth\u2019s portion at nadir of the orbital ground tracks), regular temporal sampling and short delivery delays. \nThe Lake Water Level is a recognized Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS).

Its role as an Essential Climate Variable is pivotal, serving as the foundation for cloud formation, cloud physics, and significantly impacting the Earth's heat budget through its proficient absorption of both long and short-wave radiation.\nThis catalogue entry presents two extensive, high-quality observational datasets of TCWV, specifically tailored for climate analysis and applications.\nThe dataset combines Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) retrievals in the near-infrared (NIR) across terrestrial and coastal regions with Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) TCWV retrievals in the microwave spectrum over ocean surfaces. Additionally, an associated dataset accessible in the Related Data section, offers TCWV specifics over oceanic areas, computed using distinct sensors and algorithms but with higher temporal resolution.\nThe SSM/I, a well-established instrument, adeptly retrieves TCWV over open ocean surfaces, and provides a long time series and global coverage at a reasonable resolution. The MERIS TCWV dataset provides a continuous data record spanning from May 2002 to March 2012, aligning with the TCWV requirements for the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) Observing Systems Capability Analysis and Review Tool (OSCAR). \nUtilizing a differential absorption technique centered at 940 nm in the NIR spectrum, MERIS ensures a robust retrieval methodology proven reliable for sensors within the water vapor absorption band. Covering nearly a decade, this MERIS dataset delivers products of global coverage with a reasonable resolution and good uncertainty estimate. Although not necessarily needed as input for the retrieval, ERA-Interim reanalysis TCWV serves as a priori information. These parameters are not provided in the final dataset.\nSSM/I and MERIS retrievals were merged in order to have global coverage with each instrument used to its full potential.\nWithin the ESA Water Vapour Climate Change Initiative Project (WV_cci) the NIR based TCWV retrievals over land, coasts and sea-ice were improved and in addition to MERIS data from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) were used as input data over land. \nThe NIR data were combined with TCWV data from EUMETSAT's Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF) Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite Data (HOAPS) over open ocean. This is the total column water vapour COMBI product. The COMBI dataset is an evolution of the \u201cMonthly total column water vapour over land and ocean from 2002 to 2012 derived from satellite observations\u201d developed in the predecessor project in Phase I.\nTCWV from 2002 to 2012\nThe total column water vapour is based on a combination of MERIS (NIR) over land surfaces and coastal areas with SSM/I data over ocean surfaces available from 2002 to 2012 on a monthly basis.\nTCWV COMBI from 2002 to 2017\nFor the total column water vapour COMBI product, SSM/I observations were used to generate TCWV data over the global ice-free ocean (EUMETSAT CM SAF HOAPS) while MERIS, MODIS and OLCI observations were used over land. These NIR data were combined with TCWV data from EUMETSAT CM SAF HOAPS and is available from 2002\u20132017 on both daily and monthly basis.\nThis dataset is produced by EUMETSAT CM SAF on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).", "keywords": ["Temporal coverage: Past", "Spatial coverage: Global", "Temporal coverage: Present", "Product type: Satellite observations", "Variable domain: Atmosphere (upper air)", "Provider: Copernicus C3S"], "license": "proprietary", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[0.0, -89.0, 360.0, 89.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["2002-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2017-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-total-column-water-vapour-land-ocean"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/eumetsat-cm-saf/eumetsat-cm-saf_c6b0bfdfe4e5d22b6a0c1c62a1897d188c01a96fc49ede5f0de403ef09d48d78.pdf", "title": "EUMETSAT CM SAF products licence"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-total-column-water-vapour-land-ocean/form_e81f35a5784a1695c4991b55bb505f1c7f041a04fefbcaf8b950afb18513fab3.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-total-column-water-vapour-land-ocean/constraints_8a7404f14b71c763373c90c78c01196720cc8b49f39647f592dcf9756ce457c1.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-total-column-water-vapour-land-ocean", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-total-column-water-vapour-land-ocean/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-total-column-water-vapour-land-ocean/layout_3dffc95f8876e30f7259386379ac4bf41b613f94e0911146623fb546efda0107.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-earth-radiation-budget", "title": "Earth's radiation budget from 1979 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/insitu-gridded-observations-global-and-regional", "title": "Temperature and precipitation gridded data for global and regional domains derived from in-situ and satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-cloud-properties", "title": "Cloud properties global gridded monthly and daily data from 1979 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-total-column-water-vapour-ocean", "title": "Monthly and 6-hourly total column water vapour over ocean from 1988 to 2020 derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-upper-troposphere-humidity", "title": "Upper tropospheric humidity gridded data from 1999 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-total-column-water-vapour-land-ocean/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-total-column-water-vapour-land-ocean/overview_03218b6e5adcd519588557b0c1533dfacb166a5985286ecea0ee7386223616a2.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2022-02-14T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2024-11-12T00:00:00Z", "sci:doi": "10.24381/cds.8e0e4724", "cads:disabled_reason": null}, "satellite-sea-surface-temperature-ensemble-product": {"type": "Collection", "id": "satellite-sea-surface-temperature-ensemble-product", "stac_version": "1.0.0", "title": "Sea surface temperature daily gridded data from 1981 to 2016 derived from a multi-product satellite-based ensemble", "description": "This dataset provides global daily sea surface temperature (SST) data from the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) multi-product ensemble (GMPE) produced by the European Space Agency SST Climate Change Initiative (ESA SST CCI).

An operational version, with different input products and time coverage, also exists but is not distributed by the CDS.\nThe SST analyses ingested into the GMPE system come from the following seven SST products and providers:\n\nESA SST CCI Analysis version 2.0\nESA SST CCI Analysis version 1.1\nCopernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) Reprocessing\nNational Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Optimal Interpolation (OI) Global Blended SST Analysis\nCanada Meteorological Center (CMC) 0.2-degree Global Foundation SST Analysis\nHadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST) Analysis version 2.2.0.0\nJapan Meteorological Agency (JMA) Merged satellite and in-situ Data Global Daily SST (MGDSST) Analysis\n\nThese products are all spatially complete (through use of infilling or reconstruction techniques) but were originally produced for different purposes and with different user requirements in mind. Therefore, each producer has made different choices on aspects of data production such as which input observations to use and what type of SST to represent. For example, the CMEMS OSTIA, CMC, and MGDSST analyses attempt to represent the foundation SST (water temperature free of diurnal temperature variability) while the ESA SST CCI and HadISST analyses estimate the SST at a standard depth of 20 cm. The AVHRR OI product, on the other hand, is bias-corrected to in situ observations and hence will be representative of their depths.\nThe GMPE dataset provides the median and standard deviation of the input SST products, the differences between each input product and the median, and the horizontal gradients in each of the input SST products as well as the final ensemble product. The HadISST product consists of 10 different realisations, therefore the median and standard deviation are calculated for an ensemble of 16 input fields. All fields are provided on a common 0.25 degree regular latitude-longitude grid and extend from 1 September 1981 to 31 December 2016, although some of the individual input products cover shorter periods. The dataset will not be extended beyond 2016.", "keywords": ["Temporal coverage: Past", "Spatial coverage: Global", "Product type: Satellite observations", "Variable domain: Ocean (physics)"], "license": "various", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[0.0, -89.0, 360.0, 89.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["1981-09-01T00:00:00Z", "2016-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-surface-temperature-ensemble-product"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf", "title": "Licence to use Copernicus Products"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/sst-cci-ensemble/sst-cci-ensemble_fc4cc2083cd91ab34c8ffe370c2377fcc6d58f6aec34b491c457f81dcceb0212.pdf", "title": "SST CCI ensemble dataset licence"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-sea-surface-temperature-ensemble-product/form_d36b781d4e59a1d9d9a4854e66258986f54a8c84d872938b380318790d69cebb.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-sea-surface-temperature-ensemble-product/constraints_3c549bd902a103288452457cd3fa3c16d13e48ae9096108624b5ac2bfd137804.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-sea-surface-temperature-ensemble-product", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-sea-surface-temperature-ensemble-product/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-sea-surface-temperature-ensemble-product/layout_9459448309c0d870a6d04f977a694a66c39e2c8b3f8f1ab495f503652c368ce0.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-level-global", "title": "Sea level gridded data from satellite observations for the global ocean from 1993 to present"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-ice-concentration", "title": "Sea ice concentration daily gridded data from 1978 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-ice-edge-type", "title": "Sea ice edge and type daily gridded data from 1978 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-ice-thickness", "title": "Sea ice thickness monthly gridded data for the Arctic from 2002 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-surface-temperature", "title": "Sea surface temperature daily data from 1981 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-sea-surface-temperature-ensemble-product/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-sea-surface-temperature-ensemble-product/overview_0c7b27f2e84011efc18ad30dce13eae676c70c4e221727691598b58b858450eb.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2019-02-18T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2024-11-12T00:00:00Z", "sci:doi": "10.24381/cds.ab205634", "cads:disabled_reason": null}, "satellite-total-column-water-vapour-ocean": {"type": "Collection", "id": "satellite-total-column-water-vapour-ocean", "stac_version": "1.0.0", "title": "Monthly and 6-hourly total column water vapour over ocean from 1988 to 2020 derived from satellite observations", "description": "Water vapour is has been recognised as an  Essential Climate Variable as it provides the basis for all cloud formation and physics and furthermore influences the Earth's heat budget due to its high absorbance of long and short-wave radiation.

It was produced following the World Meteorological Organisation's Observing Systems Capability Analysis and Review Tool (OSCAR)  requirements for TCWV.\nThe SSM/I and SSMIS are well-established instruments for TCWV retrieval over ice-free open ocean surfaces and provide a long time series (1987 to present) and global coverage at a reasonable resolution.\nThe TCDR HOAPS dataset is produced on behalf of EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) and the ICDR is produced within the Copernicus Climate Change Serice (C3S) project. Both products are based on the HOAPS 4.0 algorithm at DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst).

The datasets are regularly updated to incorporate recent observations. The included data sources are commonly known as  GISTEMP, Berkeley Earth, CPC and CPC-CONUS, CHIRPS, IMERG, CMORPH, GPCC and CRU, where the abbreviations are explained below.\nThese data have been constructed from high-quality analyses of meteorological station series and rain gauges around the world, and as such provide a reliable source for the analysis of weather extremes and climate trends. The regular update cycle makes these data suitable for a rapid study of recently occurred phenomena or events.\nThe NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies temperature analysis dataset (GISTEMP-v4) combines station data of the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) with the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) to construct a global temperature change estimate.\nThe Berkeley Earth Foundation dataset (BERKEARTH) merges temperature records from 16 archives into a single coherent dataset.\nThe NOAA Climate Prediction Center datasets (CPC and CPC-CONUS) define a suite of unified precipitation products with consistent quantity and improved quality by combining all information sources available at CPC and by taking advantage of the optimal interpolation (OI) objective analysis technique.\nThe Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station dataset (CHIRPS-v2) incorporates 0.05\u00b0 resolution satellite imagery and in-situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series over the African continent, suitable for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring.\nThe Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals dataset (IMERG) by NASA uses an algorithm to intercalibrate, merge, and interpolate \u201call'' satellite microwave precipitation estimates, together with microwave-calibrated infrared (IR) satellite estimates, precipitation gauge analyses, and potentially other precipitation estimators over the entire globe at fine time and space scales for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and its successor, Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite-based precipitation products. \nThe Climate Prediction Center morphing technique dataset (CMORPH) by NOAA has been created using precipitation estimates that have been derived from low orbiter satellite microwave observations exclusively. Then, geostationary IR data are used as a means to transport the microwave-derived precipitation features during periods when microwave data are not available at a location.\nThe Global Precipitation Climatology Centre dataset (GPCC) is a centennial product of monthly global land-surface precipitation based on the ~80,000 stations world-wide that feature record durations of 10 years or longer.

Cross-validation was performed at a station level, and the results have been published as a guide to the accuracy of the interpolation.\nThis catalogue entry complements the E-OBS record in many aspects, as it intends to provide high-resolution gridded meteorological observations at a global rather than continental scale. \nThese data may be suitable as a baseline for model comparisons or extreme event analysis in the CMIP5 and CMIP6 dataset.", "keywords": ["Temporal coverage: Past", "Spatial coverage: Global", "Temporal coverage: Present", "Product type: Satellite observations", "Product type: In-situ observations", "Variable domain: Atmosphere (surface)"], "license": "proprietary", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[0.0, -90.0, 360.0, 90.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["1750-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2021-11-01T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/insitu-gridded-observations-global-and-regional"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/insitu-gridded-observations-global-and-regional/insitu-gridded-observations-global-and-regional_15437b363f02bf5e6f41fc2995e3d19a590eb4daff5a7ce67d1ef6c269d81d68.pdf", "title": "Product collective licence"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/insitu-gridded-observations-global-and-regional/form_448093ee376ae7ff461741c483a7b85343430f089856fb74bd1744534c47e6b9.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/insitu-gridded-observations-global-and-regional/constraints_55015005c7720340c394e22f9b9c6f014d86e7f5a1fe08b878939a45793f89fb.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/insitu-gridded-observations-global-and-regional", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/insitu-gridded-observations-global-and-regional/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/insitu-gridded-observations-global-and-regional/layout_734e9e984f170c6eaf343ddab9940ba7b49892840310e574a20b26f9284ff7de.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-total-column-water-vapour-land-ocean", "title": "Global monthly and daily high-spatial resolution of total column water vapour from 2002 to 2017 derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-total-column-water-vapour-ocean", "title": "Monthly and 6-hourly total column water vapour over ocean from 1988 to 2020 derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-upper-troposphere-humidity", "title": "Upper tropospheric humidity gridded data from 1999 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/insitu-gridded-observations-global-and-regional/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/insitu-gridded-observations-global-and-regional/overview_e5a60aea7cdf4f6f3a2986808fb1d9f5c8c10e7848c08a21a2c6f5f3ffc01e17.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2021-12-16T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2024-11-12T00:00:00Z", "sci:doi": "10.24381/cds.11dedf0c", "cads:disabled_reason": null}, "insitu-observations-igra-baseline-network": {"type": "Collection", "id": "insitu-observations-igra-baseline-network", "stac_version": "1.0.0", "title": "In situ observations of meteorological variables from the Integrated Global Radiosounding Archive and the Radiosounding Harmonization dataset from 1978 onward", "description": "This catalogue entry provides access to vertical profiles of standard meteorological variables. It includes two datasets. \nThe first is version 2 of the Integrated Global Radiosounding Archive (IGRA) from 1978 which incorporates global \nradiosounding profiles of temperature, humidity and wind from a large number of data sources,\nwhich is 30% larger than the previous version 1. IGRA v2 is the result of quality assurance procedures applied to the\nradiosoundings data which can be grouped into eight categories: fundamental \u201csanity\u201d checks, checks on the plausibility\nand temporal consistency of surface elevation, internal consistency checks, checks for the repetition of values, \nchecks for gross position errors in ship tracks, climatology-based checks, checks on the vertical and temporal \nconsistency of temperature, and data completeness checks. No uncertainty estimation for the IGRA data is available.\nThe second is the Radiosounding HARMonization (RHARM) homogenized dataset which provides adjusted values of temperature,\nrelative humidity and wind, removing systematic effects (such as change in the measurement sensors,\nsolar radiation biases, sonde time-lag, calibration drifts, station relocation etc.) at 700 IGRA radiosounding stations\nand radiosoundings from ships.\nRHARM includes twice daily (0000 and 1200 UTC) radiosonde data at the mandatory levels (listed below).\nAt pressure levels lower than 10 hPa, temperature harmonized values are not provided because of the paucity of available \nobservations and the issues affecting the measurements at those levels.\nRelative humidity adjustments and data provision have been limited to 250 hPa owing to pervasive sensor \nperformance issues at greater altitudes. \nMoreover, an estimation of the measurement uncertainty is provided for each value of the time series. \nThe radiosounding significance levels are also adjusted per interpolation along with the corresponding uncertainties. \nThe RHARM dataset thus inherits the IGRA quality assurance procedures, and additional quality checks are then applied,\nperforming tests on physical plausibility, accuracy of the bias adjustment, presence of outliers, and coherency check\nfor the adjustments applied at the significant levels. \nThe IGRA dataset is provided by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) also through the IGRA data portal: \n\nIGRA data portal.\n\nThe RHARM dataset has been specifically developed for the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).\nRadiosoundings can be downloaded as comma-separated values (CSV) files organised in two different ways:\n\nCSV one row per level: for each observed height all variables are provided as individual columns in one row. Each main variable has its dedicated columns for total uncertainty, where applies (referenced as csv-lev in the variable lists below).\nCSV one row per observation: (no aggregation) each row provides information about one variable at one level only.

The blended time series from the station network of the European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D) project form the basis for the E-OBS gridded dataset. All station data are sourced directly from the European National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) or other data holding institutions. For a considerable number of countries the number of stations used is the complete national network and therefore much more dense than the station network that is routinely shared among NMHSs (which is the basis of other gridded datasets). The density of stations gradually increases through collaborations with NMHSs within European research contracts. \nInitially, in 2008, this gridded dataset was developed to provide validation for the suite of Europe-wide climate model simulations produced as part of the European Union ENSEMBLES project. While E-OBS remains an important dataset for model validation, it is also used more generally for monitoring the climate across Europe, particularly with regard to the assessment of the magnitude and frequency of daily extremes.\nThe position of E-OBS is unique in Europe because of the relatively high spatial horizontal grid spacing, the daily resolution of the dataset, the provision of multiple variables and the length of the dataset. Finally, the station data on which E-OBS is based are available through the ECA&D webpages (where the owner of the data has given permission to do so). In these respects it contrasts with other datasets.\nThe dataset is daily, meaning the observations cover 24 hours per time step. The exact 24-hour period can be different per region.

The FWI is a meteorologically based index used worldwide to estimate the fire danger and is implemented in the Global ECMWF Fire Forecasting model (GEFF). In this dataset, daily FWI values, seasonal FWI values, and other FWI derived, threshold-specific, indicators were modelled using the GEFF model to estimate the fire danger in future climate scenarios. These indicators include the number of days with moderate, high, or very high fire danger conditions as classified by the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) during the northern hemisphere's fire season (June-September):\n\nvery low: <5.2\nlow: 5.2 - 11.2\nmoderate: 11.2 - 21.3\nhigh: 21.3 - 38.0\nvery high: 38.0 - 50\nextreme: >=50.0 \n\nThis dataset may serve to assess future fire danger conditions for regions across Europe and support the development of a long-term tourism strategy to reduce the risk of forest fires on nature-based tourism infrastructure.\nThe FWI is a meteorologically based index that accounts for the effect of fuel moisture and weather conditions on fire behaviour. Daily noon values of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and 24-h accumulated precipitation are required for the calculation of the index. In order to attain the meteorological variables, projections from multiple global climate models downscaled to a regional climate model were used as input to the GEFF model. The climate models were developed within the EURO-CORDEX initiative, providing high-resolution and comparable model output centered on the European domain. In order to assess the impact of climate change, the GEFF model is run for four different climate scenarios: the present climate (labelled 'historical'), and three Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios consistent with an optimistic emission scenario where emissions start declining beyond 2020 (RCP2.6), a scenario where emissions start declining beyond 2040 (RCP4.5) and a pessimistic scenario where emissions continue to rise throughout the century (RCP8.5). Historical simulations, for the period 1970-2005, are included to provide a reference for the FWI projections. An estimate of the statistical uncertainty associated with climate projections may be derived with the use of multiple climate model outcomes. This may be achieved by the user both implicitly or explicitly by selecting from a choice of mean, best case, or worst case multi-model outcomes.

The dataset consists of 39 indicators of atmospheric and snow conditions computed in a similar manner for all mountain regions in Europe at the scale of NUTS-3 regions (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) and by steps of 100 m elevation. The snow indicators are generated using the Crocus snowpack model, a multi-layer snowpack model embedded in the land surface model, SURFEX (Surface Externalis\u00e9e). In order to assess the impact of climate change, the model is run for four different climate scenarios: the present climate (labelled 'historical'), and three Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios that correspond to an optimistic emission scenario where emissions start declining beyond 2020 (RCP2.6), a further optimistic emission scenario where emissions start declining beyond 2040 (RCP4.5) and a pessimistic scenario where emissions continue to rise throughout the century, often called the high emission scenario (RCP8.5). In order to simulate these climate scenarios the SURFEX model is forced with atmospheric fields provided by adjusted EURO-CORDEX ensemble climate projections (European branch of the Coordinated Downscaling Experiment). Regional climate models downscaled from global climate models are used to provide the high resolution, pan-European, indicators required to assess the snow reliability for all mountainous regions across Europe. In addition to the climate scenarios, a reanalysis dataset is computed using UERRA reanalysis.\nA total of 39 indicators are made available in this dataset, divided into seven distinct groups:\n\nStart and end date of snow season\nAnnual amount of machine made snow produced\nPrecipitation\nSnow depth\nSnow water equivalent\nAir temperature\nPotential snow making hours\n\nThe Crocus model makes it possible to account for both snow grooming and mechanical snow-making based upon the physical representation of these snow management practices, adding further value to the end-user by providing indicated snow management requirements under future climate conditions. However, it is not designed to replace higher resolution products available in some European regions that provide a more detailed view of ski conditions; for example, accounting for slope, local meteorological phenomena and local snow management practices. Instead this dataset presents a homogenous product at a pan-European level and hence its main goal is to compare the main features of past and future snow conditions across Europe or to compare distant destinations; for example, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe (for a given elevation and time horizon). \nThis dataset was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.",

for the bulk and the high tail) for precipitation and the normal distribution for all temperature variables. \nTemperature corrections were done conditional on the wet/dry state of the corresponding precipitation time series.\nThe seasonal variations in the biases were represented by monthly parameter windows for precipitation and a smoothed seasonal cycle for the temperature distribution

June 25, estimated by a moving window. \nAlso, the adjustment is done conditional on the wet/dry state of the corresponding precipitation series. \nThe climatology of the anomalies was derived from the HydroGFD2.0 dataset.\nIn addition, DBS\u2019s limitations lead to some data not being bias-adjusted or values beyond physically plausible ranges.\nIn those cases, DBS gives missing values as

This dataset provides an understanding of the European wave climate under the impact of climate change.

The wave climate is defined by means of wave spectral parameters such as the significant wave height and the peak wave period. In order to assess the impact of climate change on the ocean's surface wave field, the SAW model is run for three different climate scenarios: the present climate (labelled 'historical'), and two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios that correspond to an optimistic emission scenario where emissions start declining beyond 2040 (RCP4.5) and a pessimistic scenario where emissions continue to rise throughout the century often called the business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5).

The temporal resolution differs depending on the indicator, varying between; monthly, annual, and multi-annual averages.\nThis dataset was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.", "keywords": ["Product type: Reanalysis", "Temporal coverage: Past", "Spatial coverage: Global", "Variable domain: Land (biosphere)", "Provider: Copernicus C3S", "Product type: Climate indices", "Sector: Biodiversity"], "license": "proprietary", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[-180.0, -90.0, 180.0, 90.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["1979-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2018-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/sis-biodiversity-era5-regional"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf", "title": "Licence to use Copernicus Products"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/sis-biodiversity-era5-regional/form_171ec751939c5796d689392d402bfc34689aac3a5e733bd907b5abf294c3f1b2.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/sis-biodiversity-era5-regional/constraints_304a045c9b0df136a1dfc79c9aac458f4eb77a96421ef7faa89c5dc6269415f0.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/sis-biodiversity-era5-regional", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/sis-biodiversity-era5-regional/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/sis-biodiversity-era5-regional/layout_6c0dc2ba67a2e2caa254271a0b89d54d4c5ecb2cc69c4df8e378ffc0c1440baa.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/sis-biodiversity-era5-global", "title": "Global bioclimatic indicators from 1979 to 2018 derived from reanalysis"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/sis-biodiversity-cmip5-global", "title": "Global bioclimatic indicators from 1950 to 2100 derived from climate projections"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/sis-biodiversity-cmip5-regional", "title": "Downscaled bioclimatic indicators for selected regions from 1950 to 2100 derived from climate projections"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/sis-biodiversity-era5-regional/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/sis-biodiversity-era5-regional/overview_4b3eae026499048c2b0c82f7b19435c490e21bed188c7b8fa8b3f30a99e4f87b.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2021-09-09T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2024-11-12T00:00:00Z", "sci:doi": "10.24381/cds.fe90a594", "cads:disabled_reason": null}, "sis-ocean-wave-timeseries": {"type": "Collection", "id": "sis-ocean-wave-timeseries", "stac_version": "1.0.0", "title": "Ocean surface wave time series for the European coast from 1976 to 2100 derived from climate projections", "description": "The dataset presents time series of the coastal wave climate based upon ocean surface wave parameters computed for a European-wide domain. This dataset provides an understanding of the wave climate under the impact of climate change for the Northwest European Shelf and Mediterranean Sea. It provides added value for various coastal sectors and studies such as port, shipping, and coastal management.\nThe ocean surface wave fields are computed using the ECMWF's Wave Model (SAW) forced by surface wind and accounting for ice coverage in polar latitudes. The wave climate is defined by means of the integrated wave spectral parameters such as the significant wave height and the peak wave period. In order to assess the impact of climate change on the ocean's surface wave field, the SAW model is run for three different climate scenarios: the current climate (also termed historical), and two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios that correspond to an optimistic emission scenario where emissions start declining beyond 2040 (RCP4.5) and a pessimistic scenario where emissions continue to rise throughout the century often called the business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5). The wave climate in these scenarios are simulated using wind forcing from a member of the EURO-CORDEX climate model ensemble - the HIRHAM5 regional climate model downscaled from the global climate model EC-EARTH. Given that the projections of these climate scenarios are based on a single combination of the regional and global climate models, users of these data should take in consideration that there is an inevitable underestimation of the uncertainty associated with this dataset. In addition to the three climate scenarios, the time series are also computed using ERA5 reanlysis wind forcing.

Main data sources are the NCAR and NCEI upper air datasets as well as data collected at ECMWF during operational assimilation activities. Data collected during the ERA-CLIM and ERA-CLIM2 projects are another important data source.\nThe source datasets are the basis for a merged dataset, which is subject to strict quality control in order to choose the best available source in case of duplicates. The merged dataset is then homogenized in order to reduce systematic errors, which helps to reduce also the overall observation errors. These are estimated using Desroziers\u2019 method if background and analysis departure information from reanalyses available. The homogenization method is mainly based on analyzing background departure time series from reanalyses, as established in the literature. Users can download the source data, the merged and adjusted merged data, as well as the bias and uncertainty estimates. While data on significant levels are not that convenient to use due to their varying record length, they are uniquely suited for calculating climatologies of e.g. tropopause height, Convective Available Potential Energy or precipitable water. \nThe merged dataset is supposed to be the cleanest and most complete upper air dataset available for assimilation before 1979 but also for climate research.

Aerosols are minor constituents of the atmosphere by mass, but critical components in terms of impact on climate. Aerosols influence the global radiation balance directly by scattering and absorbing radiation, and indirectly through influencing cloud reflectivity, cloud cover and cloud lifetime.\nThe main variables provided by this dataset are: aerosol optical depth, fine mode aerosol optical depth, dust aerosol optical depth, single scattering albedo, aerosol layer height and aerosol extinction coefficient. These variables are derived from observations from several sensors using a set of different processing techniques. This provides the possibility to derive a large set of complementary aerosol properties needed to describe the complex nature of atmospheric aerosols.

over periods of a few weeks or months, as a result of predictable changes in some of the slow-varying components of the system. For example, ocean temperatures typically vary slowly, on timescales of weeks or months; as the ocean has an impact on the overlaying atmosphere, the variability of its properties (e.g. temperature) can modify both local and remote atmospheric conditions. Such modifications of the 'usual' atmospheric conditions are the essence of all long-range (e.g. seasonal) forecasts. This is different from a weather forecast, which gives a lot more precise detail - both in time and space - of the evolution of the state of the atmosphere over a few days into the future. Beyond a few days, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere limits the possibility to predict precise changes at local scales.

For example, ocean temperatures typically vary slowly, on timescales of weeks or months; as the ocean has an impact on the overlaying atmosphere, the variability of its properties (e.g. temperature) can modify both local and remote atmospheric conditions. Such modifications of the 'usual' atmospheric conditions are the essence of all long-range (e.g. seasonal) forecasts. This is different from a weather forecast, which gives a lot more precise detail - both in time and space - of the evolution of the state of the atmosphere over a few days into the future. Beyond a few days, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere limits the possibility to predict precise changes at local scales. This is one of the reasons long-range forecasts of atmospheric conditions have large uncertainties. To quantify such uncertainties, long-range forecasts use ensembles, and meaningful forecast products reflect a distributions of outcomes.\nGiven the complex, non-linear interactions between the individual components of the Earth system, the best tools for long-range forecasting are climate models which include as many of the key components of the system and possible; typically, such models include representations of the atmosphere, ocean and land surface.

Satellite remote sensing is the only method for regular monitoring of ocean biology on a global scale.\nRemote-sensing reflectance (or Rrs) is defined as the ratio of water-leaving radiance to downwelling irradiance and serves as the main input to algorithms used to derive other ocean colour products. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is the main photosynthetic pigment found in phytoplankton, which form the base of the marine food-web and are responsible for approximately half of global photosynthesis. Chl-a can be estimated from Rrs data using different algorithms (see details in the Documentation). Here, we provide a blended Chl-a estimate from multiple algorithms, where blending is based on the suitability of each candidate algorithm to the optical typology of a given pixel. This approach provides the best estimates of global Chl-a across a range of water types.\nThe files from this dataset contain global daily composites of merged sensor products: SeaWiFS, MERIS, MODIS Aqua, VIIRS, and (from version 5.0 onward) OLCI. Note that Rrs and Chl-a data are only available over cloud- and ice-free areas. As a result, more complete spatial coverage (as shown in the map in the upper-right corner) can be achieved by aggregating data over longer time periods.\nThis dataset is produced using the processing chain software developed by the Ocean Colour component of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative project (ESA OC-CCI).

Ozone is naturally formed in the atmosphere through the interaction between molecular oxygen and solar radiation. In the stratosphere, it acts as a shield protecting us from the UV radiation emitted by the Sun. At ground level however, it is a human health irritant and a component of smog. Ozone and climate change are strongly related. \nThe ozone abundance in the atmosphere can be measured from space using a number of different remote-sensing techniques relying on ozone absorption at UV, visible, infrared and millimeter wavelengths. Instruments use the solar light or the thermal radiation emitted by the Earth to derive the vertical distribution of ozone in nadir, limb and solar occultation observation geometries. In the measured signal, molecular absorption features characteristic of ozone are detected using appropriate retrieval algorithms and are used to quantify its abundance. \nData are available as Level-3 and/or Level-4 data products. Level-3 data correspond to measurements provided on a regular latitude/longitude after re-gridding of level-2 data (satellite orbit tracks) and averaging in time (over a month). Level-4 products are generated from Level-2 data after assimilation in a three-dimensional chemistry-transport model.\nWe distinguish between Climate Data Record (CDR) and intermediate-CDR (ICDR). For ozone datasets distributed here, both ICDR and CDR products are generated using common software and algorithms. The CDRs cover past time periods and include the sensors that are no longer in operation. They are meant to have sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to detect climate variability and change. The ICDRs are generated by satellite instruments still in operation, and are therefore regularly updated. Recent ICDR data are provided with a short-delay. They are expected to be consistent with the CDR baseline but have not undergone any extensive checking. Users are invited to read the documentation in order to determine the time coverage of each product.\nZonal averages and combined products obtained by merging data from different satellites are also provided. Nadir column data products from individual sensors are updated on a quarterly basis. All other products are updated once or twice a year.\nThis dataset is produced on behalf of C3S based on algorithm developments performed as part of the European Space Agency (ESA) Ozone Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project.", "keywords": ["Temporal coverage: Past", "Variable domain: Atmosphere (composition)", "Spatial coverage: Global", "Product type: Satellite observations"], "license": "proprietary", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[0.0, -90.0, 360.0, 90.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["1970-04-01T00:00:00Z", "2023-07-01T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-ozone-v1"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "qa", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/satellite-ozone-v1?tab=quality_assurance_tab", "title": "Quality assessment of the dataset", "type": "text/html"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf", "title": "Licence to use Copernicus Products"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-ozone-v1/form_d06a63257f954278c175a8bb758e67c5ef3e170b7057bf0ba29b07d4df8ca277.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-ozone-v1/constraints_1f7bee1d86dc95fca7380917c2d774ccfd6feb16d61d0cacd06bd913d69eb2c7.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-ozone-v1", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-ozone-v1/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-ozone-v1/layout_34d64bcfc0cdb5d80c4d44db0cf813e00c5e6a7170bcc57a082f549c6343f743.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-carbon-dioxide", "title": "Carbon dioxide data from 2002 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-aerosol-properties", "title": "Aerosol properties gridded data from 1995 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-methane", "title": "Methane data from 2002 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-ozone-v1/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-ozone-v1/overview_33cd7f94878204b94dcc702dca7a24af2954b70a7f7abdca33650face0535d64.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2020-12-21T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2024-11-03T00:00:00Z", "sci:doi": "10.24381/cds.4ebfe4eb", "cads:disabled_reason": null}, "satellite-albedo": {"type": "Collection", "id": "satellite-albedo", "stac_version": "1.0.0", "title": "Surface albedo 10-daily gridded data from 1981 to present", "description": "This dataset provides global Earth surface albedo products.

The FAPAR value results directly from the radiative transfer in the canopy which is instantaneous. It depends on canopy structure, vegetation element optical properties and illumination conditions. FAPAR is very useful as input to a number of primary productivity models based on simple efficiency considerations. FAPAR is relatively linearly related to reflectance values and is little sensitive to scaling issues. Note also that the FAPAR refers only to the green parts of the canopy.\nLeaf area Index: LAI is defined as half the developed area of photosynthetically active elements of the vegetation per unit horizontal ground area. It determines the size of the interface for exchange of energy (including radiation) and mass between the canopy and the atmosphere. This is an intrinsic canopy primary variable that should not depend on observation conditions. LAI is strongly non-linearly related to reflectance. Therefore, its estimation from remote sensing observations is scale dependent. Note that vegetation LAI as estimated from remote sensing includes all the green contributors such as the understory when existing under forests canopies. However, except when using directional observations, LAI is not directly accessible from remote sensing observations due to the possible heterogeneity in leaf distribution within the canopy volume. Therefore, remote sensing observations are rather sensitive to the \u2018effective\u2019 leaf area index, i.e. the value that provides the same diffuse gap fraction while assuming a random distribution of leaves. The difference between the actual LAI and the effective LAI may be quantified by the clumping index that roughly varies between 0.5 (very clumped canopies) and 1.0 (randomly distributed leaves). Note that similarly to the other variables, the retrieved LAI is mainly corresponding to the green elements: the correct term to be used would be GAI (Green Area Index) although we propose to still use LAI for the sake of simplicity.\nThe following product versions are available:\n\nVersion v0.0 is a brokered dataset from the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS).\nVersion v1.0 is produced by the C3S service. In this version, the theoretical framework for the CDR LAI and FAPAR algorithm capitalizes on the past experience gained in the Copernicus Global Land products (Baret et al. 2013). It capitalizes itself on the development and validation of already existing products: CYCLOPES Version 3.1 and MODIS Collection 5, and the use of neural networks. Verger et al. (2008) demonstrated that this approach could be used efficiently to estimate LAI and FAPAR from existing products provided that a strong link exists between the inputs and the outputs in the training dataset. Error propagation was included in the version v1.0 (compared to v0.0).\nVersion v2.0 is produced by the C3S service. This version is retrieved by applying the Two-stream Inversion Package (TIP) to visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) broadband albedos. TIP is based on the Two-stream Model developed by Pinty et al. 2006, which implements the two-stream approximation of radiative transfer for a homogeneous canopy (\u201c1D-canopy\u201d).\nVersion v3.0 is produced by the C3S service. This version builds on version 2 and adds a multi-sensor aspect to the LAI/FAPAR products delivered so far. The inversion of the BRDF coefficients was improved. A climatological BRDF based on SPOT-VGT is introduced as a priori information used for the inversion of the albedos which is the input for the TIP model.\nVersion v4.0 is produced by the C3S service and builds on version 3 using the Sentinel3 A/B SLSTR and OLCI dataset.\n\nPlease note that LAI version v0.0 and v1.0 represent the actual LAI. Starting from version v2.0, the LAI produced by the TIP (Two Inversion Package) model represents the \"effective\" LAI. The difference between the actual LAI and the effective LAI may be quantified by the clumping index that roughly varies between 0.5 (very clumped canopies) and 1.0 (randomly distributed leaves).", "keywords": ["Temporal coverage: Past", "Spatial coverage: Global", "Variable domain: Land (biosphere)", "Product type: Satellite observations"], "license": "various", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[0.0, -89.0, 360.0, 89.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["1998-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2020-06-01T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-lai-fapar"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf", "title": "Licence to use Copernicus Products"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/Copernicus-Global-Land-product-licence/Copernicus-Global-Land-product-licence_b1c4505df1ba9913bffacb93b7c3324c58ceb680eb34173e3c5270ed92234613.pdf", "title": "Copernicus Global Land product licence"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/vito-proba-v/vito-proba-v_d729c524b2b07d74c7af460e9caf574ccdbcb4cd08406c886737551099a4bb07.pdf", "title": "VITO licence"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-lai-fapar/form_e07867998d300193b3da7217f933c74c1d8e7c6ec22925f4713abaa252e2e075.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-lai-fapar/constraints_b9f5ac5bcbd3c83651e7403818425e68ee84c05f1cdd35602d1c64319c76ed0b.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-lai-fapar", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/satellite-lai-fapar/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-lai-fapar/layout_0e58cae2a145a06cc458fbf08075d58f0e32c338d8ab8923abb32024b28579da.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-fire-radiative-power", "title": "Fire radiative power and active fire pixels from 2020 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-land-cover", "title": "Land cover classification gridded maps from 1992 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-fire-burned-area", "title": "Fire burned area from 2001 to present derived from satellite observations"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-albedo", "title": "Surface albedo 10-daily gridded data from 1981 to present"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/satellite-lai-fapar/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/satellite-lai-fapar/overview_545f9b7ee55946f2fcb31740c2b862b202067d16e6f664b0dc316a1217a86215.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2018-07-16T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2024-11-01T00:00:00Z", "sci:doi": "10.24381/cds.7e59b01a", "cads:disabled_reason": null}, "satellite-sea-level-global": {"type": "Collection", "id": "satellite-sea-level-global", "stac_version": "1.0.0", "title": "Sea level gridded data from satellite observations for the global ocean from 1993 to present", "description": "This dataset provides gridded daily and monthly mean global estimates of sea level anomaly based on satellite altimetry measurements. The rise in global mean sea level in recent decades has been one of the most important and well-known consequences of climate warming, putting a large fraction of the world population and economic infrastructure at greater risk of flooding. However, changes in the global average sea level mask regional variations that can be one order of magnitude larger. Therefore, it is essential to measure changes in sea level over the world\u2019s oceans as accurately as possible.\nSea level anomaly is defined as the height of water over the mean sea surface in a given time and region. In this dataset sea level anomalies are computed with respect to a twenty-year mean reference period (1993-2012) using up-to-date altimeter standards.\nIn the past, the altimeter sea level datasets were distributed on the CNES AVISO altimetry portal until their production was taken over by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) in 2015 and 2016 respectively.\nThe sea level dataset provided here by C3S is climate-oriented, that is, dedicated to the monitoring of the long-term evolution of sea level and the analysis of the ocean/climate indicators, both requiring a homogeneous and stable sea level record. To achieve this, a steady two-satellite merged constellation is used at all time steps in the production system: one satellite serves as reference and ensures the long-term stability of the data record; the other satellite (which varies across the record) is used to improve accuracy, sample mesoscale processes and provide coverage at high latitudes. The C3S sea level dataset is used to produce Ocean Monitoring Indicators (e.g. global and regional mean sea level evolution), available in the CMEMS catalogue.\nThe CMEMS sea level dataset has a more operational focus as it is dedicated to the retrieval of mesoscale signals in the context of ocean modeling and analysis of the ocean circulation on a global or regional scale. Such applications require the most accurate sea level estimates at each time step with the best spatial sampling of the ocean with all satellites available, with less emphasis on long-term stability and homogeneity.\nThis dataset is updated three times a year with a delay of about 5 months relative to present time. This delay is mainly due to the timeliness of the input data, the centred processing temporal window and the validation process. However, these processing and validation steps are essential to enhance the stability and accuracy of the sea level products and make them suitable for climate applications.\nThis dataset includes estimates of sea level anomaly and absolute dynamic topography together with the corresponding geostrophic velocities, which provide an approximation of the ocean surface currents.

Glaciers play a fundamental role in the Earth\u2019s water cycles. They are one of the most important freshwater resources for societies and ecosystems and the recent increase in ice melt contributes directly to the rise of ocean levels. Due to this they have been declared as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by GCOS, the Global Climate Observing System. Within the Copernicus Services, the global gridded annual glacier mass change dataset provides information on changing glacier resources by combining glacier change observations from the Fluctuations of Glaciers (FoG) database that is brokered from World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS).\nInspired by previous methodological frameworks, a new approach was developed to combine the glacier mass balance and elevation change observations, providing a new and unique product of annual glacier mass change and related uncertainties for every hydrological year since 1975/76 distributed on a 0.5\u00b0 global regular grid. The present dataset bridges the gap regarding the spatio-temporal coverage of glacier change observations, providing for the first time in the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS) an annually resolved glacier mass change product using the glacier elevation change sample as calibration. This goal has become feasible at the global scale thanks to a new globally near-complete (96% of the world glaciers) dataset of glacier elevation change observations ingested by the FoG database.\nTo develop the distributed glacier change product, the use of glacier outlines from the C3S Glacier Area product version 2 are used. A glacier is considered to belong to a grid-point when its geometric centroid lies within the grid point. The centroid is obtained from the glacier outlines from the C3S Glacier Area product version 2. The glacier changes in Gt correspond to the total mass of water lost/gained over the glacier surface during a given year. Note that to propagate to mm/cm/m of water column on the grid cell, the grid cell area needs to be considered. Note that hydrological year vary on the Southern Hemisphere (October to September next year) and Northern Hemispheres (April to March next year). The annual distributed glacier change dataset cannot resolve for this seasonal difference and is important for the user to account for them when using the datasets.

These indicators describe how climate variability and change of essential climate variables can impact sectors such as health, agriculture, forestry, energy, tourism, or water and coastal management.\nThose indices are relevant for adaptation planning at the European and national level and their development was driven by the European Environment Agency (EEA) to address informational needs of climate change adaptation national initiatives across the EU and partner countries as expressed by user requirements and stakeholder consultation. The indices cover the hazard categories introduced by the IPCC and the European Topic Centre on Climate Change Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation (ETC-CCA). They are also made available interactively through CDS Toolbox public visualisation apps on the European Climate Data Explorer hosted on EEA\u2019s Climate-adapt site.\nThe indices are either downloaded from the CDS where available, or calculated through a specific CDS Toolbox workflow. In this way both the calculations and the resulting data are fully traceable. As they come from different datasets the underlying climate data differ in their technical specification (type and number of climate and impact models involved, bias-corrected or not, periods covered etc.). An effort was made in the dataset selection to limit the heterogeneity of the underlying dataset as ideally the indices should come from the same dataset with identical specifications.\nThe indices related to temperature, precipitation and wind (20 out of 30) were calculated from atmospheric variables in the same datasets: 'Climate and energy indicators for Europe from 2005 to 2100 derived from climate projections', and 'ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1940 to present'. The other indices are directly available from CDS datasets generated by specific theme projects. More information about this dataset can be found in the documentation.\nThe underlying datasets hosted on the CDS are:\n\nERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1940 to present - used to calculate most of the temperature, precipitation and wind speed indicators as it provides the historical and observation based baseline used to monitor the indicators.\nClimate and energy indicators for Europe from 2005 to 2100 derived from climate projections - used to calculate most of the temperature, precipitation and wind speed indicators as it provides bias-corrected sub-daily data. It is used for all the indicators except those specified in the following datasets below.\nFire danger indicators for Europe from 1970 to 2098 derived from climate projections - provides the high fire danger days and fire weather indicators.\nHydrology-related climate impact indicators from 1970 to 2100 derived from bias adjusted European climate projections - provides the river flood, river discharge, aridity actual, and mean soil moisture indicators.\nMountain tourism meteorological and snow indicators for Europe from 1950 to 2100 derived from reanalysis and climate projections - provides the snowfall amount index.\nWater level change indicators for the European coast from 1977 to 2100 derived from climate projections - provides the relative sea level rise and extreme sea level indicators.\n\nThis dataset was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.", "keywords": ["Product type: Reanalysis", "Temporal coverage: Past", "Spatial coverage: Europe", "Variable domain: Land (biosphere)", "Variable domain: Atmosphere (surface)", "Provider: Copernicus C3S", "Product type: Climate projections", "Temporal coverage: Future", "Product type: Climate indices"], "license": "proprietary", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[-25.0, 35.0, 45.0, 72.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["1940-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2100-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/sis-ecde-climate-indicators"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf", "title": "Licence to use Copernicus Products"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/sis-ecde-climate-indicators/form_8ff241379acecc3f98f85f9bceb4fbb2857e3a74e1330ce9096c495047ee9ba4.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/sis-ecde-climate-indicators/constraints_9dc1f94b9fd5286fac6b049febcc6606aba5b9eba15681f6ab3942a70585c827.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/sis-ecde-climate-indicators", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/sis-ecde-climate-indicators/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/sis-ecde-climate-indicators/layout_cc19823cc445e1987c3e4b714abcfd50674039f264c42d717c6e7bd5e0cf0771.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/sis-hydrology-variables-derived-projections", "title": "Hydrology-related climate impact indicators from 1970 to 2100 derived from bias adjusted European climate projections"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/sis-tourism-fire-danger-indicators", "title": "Fire danger indicators for Europe from 1970 to 2098 derived from climate projections"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/sis-tourism-snow-indicators", "title": "Mountain tourism meteorological and snow indicators for Europe from 1950 to 2100 derived from reanalysis and climate projections"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/sis-energy-derived-projections", "title": "Climate and energy indicators for Europe from 2005 to 2100 derived from climate projections"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/sis-ecde-climate-indicators/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/sis-ecde-climate-indicators/overview_cc56ed272db5f32fb80901f22748ea3d1d78c972c2d49782c8bbf1be6f02d720.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2024-04-25T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2024-10-31T00:00:00Z", "cads:disabled_reason": null}, "reanalysis-carra-height-levels": {"type": "Collection", "id": "reanalysis-carra-height-levels", "stac_version": "1.0.0", "title": "Arctic regional reanalysis on height levels from 1991 to present", "description": "The C3S Arctic Regional Reanalysis (CARRA) dataset contains 3-hourly analyses and hourly short term forecasts of atmospheric and surface meteorological variables (temperature, humidity, wind, cloud and pressure)  at 2.5 km resolution.

Cloud properties describe the state of the Earth\u00b4s upper-air atmosphere. Clouds have an effect on weather and climate through their contribution to the Earth\u2019s water cycle and impact on the Earth\u2019s energy budget. They influence the motion of the atmosphere on many scales and modify the atmospheric composition. By accumulating and carrying the evaporated and transpired water in the atmosphere, clouds redistribute water over the globe, which often involves precipitation. Further, the variable cloud properties determines the feedback mechanism that clouds have on the hydrological cycle, directly in terms of precipitation, but also indirectly on the Earth\u00b4s energy budget by interacting with radiation fluxes. Usually, clouds reflect more solar radiation back to space than the underlying surface and absorb and re-emit infrared (IR) radiation, leading to less IR radiation leaving the system than without clouds. According to the 5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report, clouds (together with aerosols) contribute the largest uncertainty to the estimates of the Earth\u00b4s energy budget, as well as to the potential feedback mechanisms and responses to climate change.\nThe ECV Cloud Properties contains four main variables, which can be separated into averaged cloudiness, cloud height products and cloud physical properties for ice and liquid water phase. These variables were produced by two \u201cproduct families\u201d, based on the data from different sensors and algorithms that cover the same four variables. The \"CCI product family\" was originated by different projects within different organisations at different times.

SRB represents the balance between the heating of the surface through incoming solar radiation and cooling through the emission of infra-red radiation which is a fundamental component of the surface energy budget. Small changes in the surface radiation budget can lead to large climatological responses, which makes a permanent and precise monitoring indispensable. Accurate understanding of the surface radiation budget at regional and global scales can improve the understanding of the Earth\u2019s climate system and supports research on current and anticipated climate change, as well as the evaluation of radiative processes in climate models. Better knowledge of the global and regional surface radiation budget is also required for a successful utilization of renewable energy sources, such as solar power plants.\nThe dataset contains seven variables which can be separated into solar (shortwave) and thermal (longwave) surface radiation components. Both components include incoming (downwelling), outgoing (upwelling), and the net radiation fluxes. These variables were produced by two \u201cproduct families\u201d, based on the data from different sensors and algorithms that cover the same seven variables.\nThe two families follow somewhat different nomenclatures. To help the user to navigate the different names, a table relating the names used in the download form with the names used within the files and in other datasets distributed by the Climate Data Store is added at the end of this overview. The fact that the naming is different reflects the fact that each family was originated by different projects within different organisations at different times.

It is considered an essential climate variable because it controls key atmospheric processes, including water vapour and cloud feedbacks that can amplify the climate system\u2019s response to increases in other greenhouse gases.\nThe UTH Thematic Climate Data Record (TCDR) and Interim Climate Data Record (ICDR) are derived from observations from the AMSU-B and MHS microwave humidity sounder instruments on board the NOAA- and MetOp- satellite series. Instantaneous satellite observations are used to derive a spatio-temporal averaged data record. The data are available as twice daily (one for the ascending and the other for the descending passes) averages on a regular latitude/longitude grid. Additionally, the daily mean UTH is provided as a weighted average of ascending and descending orbits for all the grid points with valid ascending and descending observations.\nUTH is the Jacobian weighted relative humidity in the upper troposphere. Its natural logarithm can be expressed as a linear function of the radiance emanated from water vapour emissions in the upper troposphere, expressed as brightness temperature. Various threshold masks are applied in order to identify and remove measurements contaminated by clouds, for example due to scattering by large ice particles in the presence of deep convection, and measurements contaminated by the surface. A viewing angle dependent analytical equation is used to convert off-nadir brightness temperatures into nadir equivalents, thereby providing a correction for limb darkening effects.\nUTH is part of the Water Vapour ECV inventory in the CDS together with Total Column Water Vapour and Tropospheric Humidity Profiles. The TCDR component of this dataset is brokered to the CDS and was originally produced on behalf of EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CMSAF) by the Met Office.

Contrary to the frozen IPCC Atlas dataset, this entry will have an evolution adding new data on a regular basis describing various types of climatic impact characteristics: heat and cold, wet and dry, snow and ice, wind and radiation, ocean, and circulation characteristics of the climate system.\nThis dataset includes gridded information with monthly/annual temporal resolution for observations/reanalyses of the recent past and climate projections for the 30 variables and indices computed from daily/monthly data across the different datasets. The climate projections are based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) / Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios.

These variables and indices are relevant for the climatic impact-drivers used in the regional assessments conducted in AR6 (Chapters 10, 11, 12 and Atlas), related to heat and cold, wet and dry, snow and ice, and wind. This dataset is particularly intended for Climate Data Store (CDS) users who want to develop customised products not directly available from the IPCC Interactive Atlas (e.g. regional information at national or subnational scales). \nThis dataset includes gridded information with monthly/annual temporal resolution for historical experiments and climate projections based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) / Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios for CMIP5/6 and CORDEX multi-model ensembles for the 22 variables and indices (computed from daily data). The ensembles are harmonised using regular grids with horizontal resolutions of 2\u00b0 (CMIP5), 1\u00b0 (CMIP6), 0.5\u00b0 (CORDEX), and 0.25\u00b0 (European CORDEX domain); details on the particular ensembles for each dataset are included in the documentation links. \nThis dataset allows the reproduction, expansion and customisation of the climate change products displayed in the IPCC Interactive Atlas.

These variables allow, among other things, to address water resource management issues and to carry out climate change impact studies. Regional surface reanalyses are a way to reconstruct these variables for past periods covering several decades using state-of-the-art models. Reanalysis combines model data with observations into a complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where a previous forecast is combined with  newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but usually at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved, reprocessed versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\nThe dataset was produced using the CERRA-Land system which consists of a land surface modelling platform SURFEX (V8.1) and a daily (24-h) total accumulated precipitation assimilation system. Most of the data are forecasts generated based on the open-loop integration of the SURFEX. The observations are not directly used in their production but have an indirect influence through the atmospheric forcing  (e.g. 2m temperature) from the CERRA high-resolution reanalysis and precipitation reanalysis system used to integrate in time the SURFEX model. No downscaling method was used to build up the input forcing data because the CERRA-Land system has the same integration domain (e.g. grid spacing, orography) as the CERRA high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis. SURFEX was run offline, that is without feedback to the atmospheric analysis performed in the CERRA data assimilation cycles.\nTo solve both heat and water transfer equations in the soil, a discretisation of the soil into 14 layers was used. The surface precipitation analysis and the 12 snow layers model included in the CERRA-Land system significantly improve the representation of the snowpack over Europe in comparison with the CERRA dataset.\nThis dataset describes the evolution of soil moisture, soil temperature and snowpack in a consistent view over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared to ERA5 and ERA5-Land. The temporal and spatial resolutions of CERRA-Land data recommend this dataset, for example, for water resource management and climate change studies.\nThe added value of the CERRA-Land data with respect to the global reanalysis products is expected to come, for example, with the higher horizontal resolution that permits the usage of a better description of the model topography and physiographic data.\nMore information about the CERRA-Land dataset can be found in the Documentation section.", "keywords": ["Product type: Reanalysis", "Temporal coverage: Past", "Spatial coverage: Europe", "Variable domain: Land (hydrology)", "Variable domain: Atmosphere (surface)"], "license": "proprietary", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[17.0, 20.0, 35.0, 65.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["1984-08-24T00:00:00Z", null]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/reanalysis-cerra-land"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf", "title": "Licence to use Copernicus Products"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/reanalysis-cerra-land/form_83929b25bec50b2a51ba526769c031ea0a363d5f4aa8ec9cc0e2d7dceb38da9f.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/reanalysis-cerra-land/constraints_104224dd957854d90df31a6693d7d260bec37a7b4965983a2bc098474d5eeae2.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/reanalysis-cerra-land", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/reanalysis-cerra-land/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/reanalysis-cerra-land/layout_641b86b8d43ed1d16c71de55fc1391876043ee38ce1b7cddcf72deea228ca718.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/reanalysis-cerra-pressure-levels", "title": "CERRA sub-daily regional reanalysis data for Europe on pressure levels from 1984 to present"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/reanalysis-cerra-single-levels", "title": "CERRA sub-daily regional reanalysis data for Europe on single levels from 1984 to present"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/reanalysis-cerra-land/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/reanalysis-cerra-land/overview_d8eae3742517018ee23f268dd236e977e6347d704abcc8d5f3fb8df282377362.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2022-11-15T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2022-11-15T00:00:00Z", "sci:doi": "10.24381/cds.a7f3cd0b", "cads:disabled_reason": null}, "reanalysis-cerra-model-levels": {"type": "Collection", "id": "reanalysis-cerra-model-levels", "stac_version": "1.0.0", "title": "CERRA sub-daily regional reanalysis data for Europe on model levels from 1984 to present", "description": "The Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis (CERRA) datasets provide spatially and temporally consistent historical reconstructions of meteorological variables in the atmosphere and at the surface.

Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The decadal data in the Climate Data Store (CDS) are a quality-controlled subset of the full DCPP.\nCMIP6-DCPP data addresses the ability of the climate system to be predicted on annual, multi-annual and decadal timescales. The information generated by the DCPP can provide a basis for socially relevant operational climate predictions on annual to decadal timescales. The use of these data is mostly aimed at:\n\nassessing historical decadal prediction skill (hindcasts);\nexploring the potential for operational forecast production (forecasts).\n\nThe term \"experiments\" in the context of DCPP refers to two categories of simulations:\n\nhindcast experiments which cover the recent past from 1960 and are constrained by climate observations.\nforecast experiments that are initialised with observations from 2019 onwards and are constrained by conditions of the ssp245 illustrative climate scenario.\n\nFor DCPP experiments, each model is used to produce ensemble of simulations that are initialised annually. The ensemble members provide uncertainty information and they are concatenated into one data file for each model.\nThis catalogue entry provides daily and monthly near surface air temperature, precipitation, sea level pressure, daily minimum/maximum near surface air temperature and 500 hPa geopotential height data. The data is accompanied with an option to apply spatial and/or temporal subsetting to data requests.\nThe data have been produced by the institutes participating in the sectoral decadal demonstrator service developed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) in 2021.

Multiple vertical levels are excluded from this catalogue entry.\nCMIP5 data are used extensively in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Reports (the latest one is IPCC AR5, which was published in 2014). The use of these data is mostly aimed at:\n\naddressing outstanding scientific questions that arose as part of the IPCC reporting process;\nimproving the understanding of the climate system;\nproviding estimates of future climate change and related uncertainties;\nproviding input data for the adaptation to the climate change;\nexamining climate predictability and exploring the ability of models to predict climate on decadal time scales;\nevaluating how realistic the different models are in simulating the recent past.\n\nThe term \"experiments\" refers to the three main categories of CMIP5 simulations:\n\nHistorical experiments which cover the period where modern climate observations exist.

The period covered is typically 1850-2005.;\nEnsemble of experiments from the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP), which prescribes the oceanic variables for all models and during all period of the experiment.

Essential climate variables are generated with the UERRA-HARMONIE and the MESCAN-SURFEX systems. UERRA-HARMONIE is a 3-dimensional variational data assimilation system, while MESCAN-SURFEX is a complementary surface analysis system. Using the Optimal Interpolation method, MESCAN provides the best estimate of daily accumulated precipitation and six-hourly air temperature and relative humidity at 2 meters above the model topography.\nThe land surface platform SURFEX is forced with downscaled forecast fields from UERRA-HARMONIE as well as MESCAN analyses. It is run offline, i.e. without feedback to the atmospheric analysis performed in MESCAN or the UERRA-HARMONIE data assimilation cycles. Using SURFEX offline allows taking full benefit of precipitation analysis and to use the more advanced physics options to better represent surface variables such as surface temperature and surface fluxes, and soil processes related to water and heat transfer in the soil and snow.\nIn general, reanalysis combines model data with observations into a complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (6 hours in the UERRA-HARMONIE system) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\nThe assimilation system is able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data from poor data. The laws of physics allow for estimates at locations where data coverage is low. The provision of estimates at each grid point in Europe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with. \nThe observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the initially much sparser networks will lead to less accurate estimates. UERRA-HARMONIE data is available from 1961 and is updated once a month with a delay to real-time of about 4 months. The system provides four analyses per day \u2013 at 0 UTC, 6 UTC, 12 UTC, and 18 UTC. Between the analyses, forecasts of the system are available with hourly resolution. Hence, estimates of the status of the atmosphere are available for every hour since 1961. Moreover, forecasts up to 30 hours are available from the analyses initialised at 0 UTC and 12 UTC.\nIn addition to observations in the model domain, a regional reanalysis needs information at its lateral boundaries. For the UERRA-HARMONIE system, this information is taken from the global reanalyses ERA40 (until the end of 1978) and ERA-interim (from 1979). The improvement over global products comes with the higher horizontal resolution that allows incorporating more regional details, e.g. topography. Moreover, it enables the system even to consider more observations at places with dense observation networks. The UERRA-HARMONIE regional reanalysis is produced at a horizontal resolution of 11km and MESCAN SURFEX provides data at a resolution of 5.5km.\nFor the UERRA-HARMONIE system, variables are produced at the surface and on model levels (65 levels) but are also interpolated to two other level types: pressure levels (24 levels between 1000-10hPa), and height levels (11 levels between 15m-500m). The output of height levels were introduced with special focus on the wind energy sector and their needs. Soil data is available on 14 levels from the surface to a depth of 12m. The number of available parameters varies between the different level types.\nIn order to make data access more manageable, the UERRA-HARMONIE and MESCAN-SURFEX dataset has been split into four records.

The term \"single levels\" is used to express that the variables are 2D-matrices computed on one vertical level which can be surface (or a level close to the surface) or a dedicated pressure level in the atmosphere. Multiple vertical levels are excluded from this catalogue entry.\nHigh-resolution Regional Climate Models (RCMs) can provide climate change information on regional and local scales in relatively fine detail, which cannot be obtained from coarse scale Global Climate Models (GCMs). This is manifested in better description of small-scale regional climate characteristics and also in more accurate representation of extreme events. Consequently, outputs of such RCMs are indispensable in supporting regional and local climate impact studies and adaptation decisions. RCMs are not independent from the GCMs, since the GCMs provide lateral and lower boundary conditions to the regional models. In that sense RCMs can be viewed as magnifying glasses of the GCMs.\nThe CORDEX experiments consist of RCM simulations representing different future socio-economic scenarios (forcings), different combinations of GCMs and RCMs and different ensemble members of the same GCM-RCM combinations. This experiment design through the ensemble members allows for studies addressing questions related to the key uncertainties in future climate change. These uncertainties come from differences in the scenarios of future socio-economic development, the imperfection of regional and global models used and the internal (natural) variability of the climate system. This experiment design allows for studies addressing questions related to the key uncertainties in future climate change:\n\nwhat will future climate forcing be?\nwhat will be the response of the climate system to changes in forcing?\nwhat is the uncertainty related to natural variability of the climate system?\n\nThe term \"experiment\" in the CDS form refers to three main categories:\n\nEvaluation: CORDEX experiment driven by ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis for a past period. These experiments can be used to evaluate the quality of the RCMs using perfect boundary conditions as provided by a reanalysis system. The period covered is typically 1980-2010;\nHistorical: CORDEX experiment which covers a period for which modern climate observations exist. Boundary conditions are provided by GCMs. These experiments, that follow the observed changes in climate forcing, show how the RCMs perform for the past climate when forced by GCMs and can be used as a reference period for comparison with scenario runs for the future. The period covered is typically 1950-2005;\nScenario: Ensemble of CORDEX climate projection experiments using RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) forcing scenarios. These scenarios are the RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios providing different pathways of the future climate forcing. Boundary conditions are provided by GCMs. The period covered is typically 2006-2100.\n\nIn CORDEX, the same experiments were done using different RCMs (labelled as \u201cRegional Climate Model\u201d in the CDS form).\nIn addition, for each RCM, there is a variety of GCMs, which can be used as lateral boundary conditions. The GCMs used are coming from the CMIP5 (5th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) archive. These GCM boundary conditions are labelled as \u201cGlobal Climate Model\u201d in the form and are also available in the CDS.\nAdditionally, the uncertainty related to internal variability of the climate system is sampled by running several simulations with the same RCM-GCM combination. On the forms, these are indexed as separate ensemble members (the naming convention for ensemble members is available in the documentation). For each GCM, the same experiment was repeatedly done using slightly different conditions (like initial conditions or different physical parameterisations for instance) producing in that way an ensemble of experiments closely related. More details behind these sequential ensemble numbers is available in the detailed documentation.\nThe data are produced by the institutes and modelling centres participating in the different CORDEX domains with partial support from different international and national contributions including support from COPERNICUS for some of the EURO-CORDEX runs.\nThe data can be used for commercial purposes (unrestricted use) with the exception of the simulations from the following RCMs: BOUN-RegCM4-3 model (for Central Asia and Middle East and North Africa domains) and RU-CORE-RegCM4-3 model (for South-East Asia domain).

The improvement over global reanalysis products comes with the\nhigher horizontal resolution that allows incorporating more regional details (e.g. topography).\nMoreover, it enables the system even to use more observations at places with dense observation networks.", "keywords": ["Product type: Reanalysis", "Temporal coverage: Past", "Spatial coverage: Europe", "Variable domain: Land (hydrology)", "Provider: Copernicus C3S"], "license": "proprietary", "extent": {"spatial": {"bbox": [[335.0, 34.0, 40.0, 72.0]]}, "temporal": {"interval": [["2018-10-18T00:00:00Z", "2019-07-31T00:00:00Z"]]}}, "links": [{"rel": "self", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/reanalysis-uerra-europe-soil-levels"}, {"rel": "parent", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "root", "type": "application/json", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/"}, {"rel": "license", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf", "title": "Licence to use Copernicus Products"}, {"rel": "form", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/reanalysis-uerra-europe-soil-levels/form_900816e6c1e65d87ae7a2ef2c491f300c5aa3638968368ff1093c874176f851f.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "constraints", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/reanalysis-uerra-europe-soil-levels/constraints_2b9550e7bedf3bdf793a3f4d33c1658ca23797361b7e9c4f081ab769a183c35a.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "retrieve", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/reanalysis-uerra-europe-soil-levels", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "costing_api", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/reanalysis-uerra-europe-soil-levels/costing", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "layout", "href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/reanalysis-uerra-europe-soil-levels/layout_1f2da3f2577f92c30cef8e0bab8d25ca9386f6294fb7c23663d517e4c38868cc.json", "type": "application/json"}, {"rel": "related", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/reanalysis-uerra-europe-single-levels", "title": "UERRA regional reanalysis for Europe on single levels from 1961 to 2019"}, {"rel": "messages", "href": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/catalogue/v1/collections/reanalysis-uerra-europe-soil-levels/messages", "title": "All messages related to the selected dataset"}], "assets": {"thumbnail": {"href": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/reanalysis-uerra-europe-soil-levels/overview_d10d6cda7a407ae2d85accf3edb98be7f125f01c6fd771419d08825b135da849.png", "type": "image/jpg", "roles": ["thumbnail"]}}, "published": "2019-02-15T00:00:00Z", "updated": "2019-02-15T00:00:00Z", "sci:doi": "10.24381/cds.33525ca7", "cads:disabled_reason": null}, "projections-cmip5-daily-pressure-levels": {"type": "Collection", "id": "projections-cmip5-daily-pressure-levels", "stac_version": "1.0.0", "title": "CMIP5 daily data on pressure levels", "description": "This catalogue entry provides daily climate projections on pressure levels from a large number of experiments, models, members and time periods computed in the framework of fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5).
