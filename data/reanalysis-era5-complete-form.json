[{"details": {"text": "The access to this dataset  can be **slow**  and is intended for **expert** users to access the **complete** set of data produced by the  ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis on its native grid.\nIt includes data that is  **not** provided through the other, more convenient [ERA5 catalogue entries for regridded data][ERA5-entries]:\n\n* native grid rather than regridded into regular lat-lon,\n\n* model and potential temperature/vorticity levels, in addition to  pressure levels and  surface fields,\n\n* full two-dimensional ocean-wave spectra in addition to integrated wave parameters,\n\n* explicit distinction between analysis, short-forecast and other, more technical, products.\n\nAn overview of the range of products is provided [here] [era5-doc]. <br/>\nA full list of available variables can be found [here] [era5-parameters]. <br/>\n\n\n**Install the API**<br/>\nAccess to  ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis  is provided through the Climate Data Store Application Program Interface (CDS API).\nThis requires the installation  of  the CDS API application in the users' computer. More information on  how to install can be found [here][cds-api-how-to].<br/>\nYou also need to provide your user identity and public key, which can be found when you are logged in the Catalogue and click on your username at the top left.\n\n\n**Example of a request**<br/>\nRequests for these data using the CDS API have to use the MARS request syntax. <br/>\nYou can discover the ERA5-complete structure (1940-present) and learn how to build a CDS API request by following these steps:\n\n1. Open the [MARS ERA5 catalogue][era5-mars-catalogue].\n\n2. Browse for discovery, and browse your way to the parameter level to build a request.\n\n3. Use the \" View MARS request \" feature - this will help you build your own CDS API Python script to retrieve the data through the CDS API.\n\n4. Tailor your request to \n    1. re-grid to the desired regular lat-lon resolution\n    2. convert to NetCDF (works for regular grids only, so you need to use the 'grid' keyword as well)\n    3. select sub areas\n\nHere is an example to download model level ERA5 analysis data (temperature) for a given area at a regular lat/lon grid in NetCDF format.\n\n       #!/usr/bin/env python\n       import cdsapi\n       c = cdsapi.Client()\n       c.retrieve('reanalysis-era5-complete', { # Requests follow MARS syntax\n                                                # Keywords 'expver' and 'class' can be dropped. They are obsolete\n                                                # since their values are imposed by 'reanalysis-era5-complete'\n           'date'    : '2013-01-01',            # The hyphens can be omitted\n           'levelist': '1/10/100/137',          # 1 is top level, 137 the lowest model level in ERA5.

Adapt as you wish.\n\n**How to access ERA5.1**<br/>\nFor ERA5.1 the same method can be used as above, however,\n\n* there is no dedicated online cacalogue, so for disovery of products and API request the [MARS ERA5 catalogue][era5-mars-catalogue] needs to be used as well,\n\n* data is only available from January 2000 to December 2006 inclusive,\n\n* use 'reanalysis-era5.1-complete' rather than 'reanalysis-era5-complete'.\n\n**Terms of use**<br/>\nUsers need to accept the Terms of use of this datase by clicking **Accept Terms** in the box below before being able to download the data.\nPlease note that this box is only visible after login.\nThis needs to be accepted only once and the CDS will remember that you have accepted the licence.\n\n [ERA5-entries]: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels \n [era5-doc]: https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation\n [cds-api-how-to]: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to\n [era5-parameters]: https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Parameterlistings\n [era5-mars-catalogue]: https://apps.ecmwf.int/data-catalogues/era5/?class=ea\n\n"}, "label": "", "name": "download_instructions", "required": false, "type": "FreeEditionWidget"}, {"type": "LicenceWidget", "name": "licences", "label": "Terms of use", "help": null, "details": {"licences": [{"id": "licence-to-use-copernicus-products", "revision": 12, "label": "Licence to use Copernicus Products", "contents_url": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-productsv12_c742a3ce47ae53486a6bc9012f0496e655cd94f19fb2d01b4f6e32af69276ed1.md", "attachment_url": "https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int:443/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf"}]}}]
